<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Boys:</span> This book is a complete story
in itself, but forms the sixth volume in a line issued
under the general title, &#8220;The Second Rover
Boys Series for Young Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>As noted in some volumes of the first series,
this line was started years ago with the publication
of &#8220;The Rover Boys at School,&#8221; &#8220;On the
Ocean,&#8221; and &#8220;In the Jungle,&#8221; in which I introduced
my readers to Dick, Tom and Sam Rover
and their relatives and friends. The twenty volumes
of the First Series related the doings of
these three Rover boys while attending Putnam
Hall Military Academy, Brill College, and while
on numerous outings.</p>
<p>Having finished their education, the three
young men established themselves in business and
became married. Dick Rover was blessed with
a son and a daughter, as was also his brother
Sam, while Tom became the proud father of a
pair of the liveliest kind of twin boys.</p>
<p>From their home in New York City the young
Rovers were sent to a boarding school, as related
in the first volume of the Second Series, entitled
&#8220;The Rover Boys at Colby Hall.&#8221; From that
institution of learning the scene was shifted to
&#8220;Snowshoe Island,&#8221; where the lads spent a mid-winter
outing. Then they rejoined their fellow-cadets
and had some strenuous doings while
&#8220;Under Canvas.&#8221; After that, in a volume entitled
&#8220;The Rover Boys on a Hunt,&#8221; I related how
they uncovered the mystery surrounding a strange
house in the woods. And following this came a
trip to Texas and Oklahoma, where, &#8220;In the Land
of Luck,&#8221; the boys aided Dick Rover in his efforts
to locate some valuable oil wells.</p>
<p>In the present volume the scene is shifted back
to Colby Hall and then to a ranch in the West
where some remarkable happenings await our
young heroes.</p>
<p>From reports received I am assured that the
sale of this line of books has now passed the <i>three
million</i> mark! This is as astonishing as it is
gratifying. I sincerely trust that the reading of
the volumes will do all of the boys and girls good.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>SNOW AND SNOWBALLS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Line up, fellows! No crowding ahead in this
contest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Jack, give me some elbow room if you
want me to do any real snowball throwing!&#8221; cried
Fred Rover.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the elbow room you want,&#8221; returned his
cousin gayly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember the prize!&#8221; shouted Andy Rover
to the cadets who were stringing themselves out
in a ragged line. &#8220;The first fellow to throw a
snowball over the top of the barn gets a sock
doughnut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For gracious sake! what do you call a sock
doughnut?&#8221; demanded Phil Franklin, another
cadet, as he paused in the act of rounding up a
snowball he was making.</p>
<p>&#8220;A sock doughnut is one with a big hole in it,&#8221;
answered Andy, with a grin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then my socks must be all of the doughnut
variety,&#8221; put in one of the cadets dolefully.
&#8220;They are always full of holes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind the socks now!&#8221; cried Randy
Rover. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see who can put the first snowball
over the barn.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon of a day in January
and a number of the cadets of Colby Hall
had been amusing themselves in the snow which
covered the ground to a depth of nearly a foot.
They had started in to snowballing each other,
but had then grown more serious and had built
several snow forts and likewise two or three
snowmen which later they had taken great sport
in knocking apart. Then some one had suggested
that they try their skill at seeing who could throw,
the highest and farthest, and this had led to the
present contest.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll mark off a line about a hundred feet
from the main barn,&#8221; Jack Rover had announced.
&#8220;And then we&#8217;ll see who can throw highest over
the roof.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four Rovers were accompanied by half a
dozen of their chums and six or eight others, and
at the word from Jack the snowballs began to fly
at a lively rate, a few landing on the roof of the
big barn and the majority hitting the side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, look out that you don&#8217;t break a window,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
warned Gif Garrison. &#8220;If you do, you&#8217;ll
have an account to settle with Captain Dale.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here she goes!&#8221; yelled Dan Soppinger, and
let fly with so much strength that the snowball
sailed up to the very ridgepole of the barn and
disappeared on the other side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Dan draws first blood!&#8221; shouted
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! Dan didn&#8217;t throw over the barn, he
just slid over it,&#8221; snickered Randy.</p>
<p>Jack was hard at work making a small and perfectly
round ball. Now, taking careful aim, he
let fly with all his might.</p>
<p>&#8220;There she goes fair and square,&#8221; he announced
with pardonable pride, as the snowball
cleared the top of the barn by several feet and
disappeared beyond.</p>
<p>The snowball had scarcely been thrown when
two other balls thrown by Fred and another cadet
went sailing over the barn. Then those in the
contest seemed to acquire better skill, and soon
nearly every one of them was topping the barn
with the missiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phew! some hot work, I&#8217;ll say,&#8221; panted Will
Hendry, usually called Fatty because he was the
stoutest boy in the school.</p>
<p>&#8220;This exercise will do you good, Fatty,&#8221; returned
Fred. &#8220;You need to reduce.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If Fatty keeps on he&#8217;ll be eating Colby Hall
poor,&#8221; announced Spouter Powell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! I don&#8217;t eat any more than any of you,&#8221;
grumbled Fatty. &#8220;Fact is, I hold myself down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! listen to that, will you?&#8221; exclaimed Andy.
&#8220;Fatty says he holds himself down! And this
morning I saw him storing away three helpings
of sausages and about &#8217;steen dozen buckwheat
cakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the kind! I didn&#8217;t have a bit more
than you had,&#8221; growled Hendry. He broke off
suddenly. &#8220;Hello! what&#8217;s up now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi! Hi! What&#8217;s the meaning o&#8217; this?&#8221; cried
a voice from around one end of the big barn, and
a man, dressed in overalls and a heavy cap and
carrying a broom, appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello there, Bob Nixon!&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;What&#8217;s
wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be a whole lot wrong if you fellows
keep on throwing those snowballs much farther,&#8221;
answered Bob Nixon, who was a chauffeur for
the Hall and who did all sorts of odd jobs in the
winter time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did we hit you?&#8221; questioned Phil Franklin.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure did&mdash;on the back and on my hand,&#8221;
answered Nixon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t know anybody was around on that
side of the barn,&#8221; announced Andy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you did. But never mind me.
What I want to know is, do you fellows intend to
smash all the glass in those hotbed frames out
yonder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great salt mackerel!&#8221; ejaculated Fred. &#8220;I forgot
those hotbed frames were there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the glass is out of &#8217;em, anyway, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; questioned Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was out. But they&#8217;ve been setting some of
&#8217;em in again, getting ready for some early stuff.
You&#8217;ve sent those snowballs up to within ten or
fifteen feet of where the frames are located.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh! it&#8217;s a good thing you told us of this,&#8221;
burst out Fatty Hendry. &#8220;We might have had a
nice lot of glassware to pay for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not you, Fatty,&#8221; grinned Andy. &#8220;You never
even hit the top of the barn. If you break any
glass it will be in some of those basement windows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on up to the other end of the barn,&#8221;
suggested Gif. &#8220;Then the snowballs will fly right
out into the open field and do no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care where you throw &#8217;em as
long as you don&#8217;t get into mischief,&#8221; answered
Bob Nixon, and disappeared into the barn.</p>
<p>After that the cadets continued to throw over
the structure for some time. But then they gradually
lost interest, and as the short winter day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
was coming rapidly to an end some hurried into
the Hall to do a little extra school work before
the bell should ring for supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what next?&#8221; questioned Fred Rover,
when he and his three cousins and Gif, Phil and
Spouter found themselves left alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a great scheme for to-night if you
fellows will help,&#8221; announced Randy. He and
his twin brother were always ready for a joke.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; questioned Jack quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This snow is just soft enough for rolling some
big balls, as we found out this afternoon,&#8221; answered
his cousin. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with making
a whole lot of big snowballs and placing &#8217;em
in some of the bedrooms to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, that&#8217;s the talk!&#8221; cried his twin merrily.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to place a couple in Codfish&#8217;s room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly deserves &#8217;em,&#8221; added Fred.
&#8220;He&#8217;s getting to be just as big a sneak as he ever
was. All of our kindness to him seems to have
been useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I thought he was going to turn over a
new leaf,&#8221; declared Jack. &#8220;I wonder if some of
the other fellows haven&#8217;t been teasing him and
that has made him go back to his old tricks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know one person I&#8217;d like to treat to some
big snowballs!&#8221; broke out Fred. &#8220;That&#8217;s Professor
Duke.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, say! I&#8217;d like to square up with him myself,&#8221;
burst out Andy. &#8220;Gee! he certainly did
have it in for us yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Duke is certainly a sour one&mdash;much
worse than Asa Lemm ever dared to be,&#8221; came
from Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of Duke when I mentioned it,&#8221;
said Randy. &#8220;You know he has his room in our
building instead of with the other professors in
Colonel Colby&#8217;s residence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to get in bad with the colonel,&#8221;
remarked Fred seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I think we can fix it so that nobody will
know who did it,&#8221; returned his cousin.</p>
<p>The matter was talked over for several minutes,
and then, having agreed on their plan for
more fun, the Rover boys and their chums set to
work rolling a number of snowballs which were
two feet or more in diameter. These they placed
close to the school building at a point where there
was a series of fire-escapes leading down from
the upper halls of the institution.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can let down the ladder just as soon as
we&#8217;re ready to turn the trick,&#8221; announced Randy.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe anybody will notice it, for it will
be dark and so cold that most everybody will be
indoors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to be on our guard to make certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
that Codfish or Duke or somebody else doesn&#8217;t
spot us,&#8221; said Spouter Powell. &#8220;Of course it
wouldn&#8217;t hurt if some of the regular fellows found
us out, because they&#8217;d keep it to themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>It must be confessed that the Rover boys were
rather preoccupied in mind during supper that
evening. In fact, Andy grew so thoughtless that
he salted some eggs he was eating three times, so
that when he finally came to his senses the food
had to be pushed aside. This happened just as
Professor Snopper Duke was passing, and the
new teacher eyed the young cadet suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter with that omelet, Rover?&#8221;
he demanded, in his high-pitched, nervous tone
of voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing the matter with it, sir,&#8221; answered
Andy. &#8220;Only I somehow forgot and salted it too
much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; returned Snopper Duke sarcastically.
&#8220;Is that the way you waste food?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. It was only a mistake,&#8221; answered
Andy meekly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be made to eat that omelet,&#8221;
continued the professor severely. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let such
a thing happen again.&#8221; And then, with his eyes
rolling around among the other cadets to see if
anything else might be wrong, he passed slowly
down among the tables of the mess hall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t he a perfect little lamb!&#8221; murmured
Randy. &#8220;So awfully tender-hearted!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody ought to wring his neck,&#8221; grumbled
his twin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same, Andy, you&#8217;d better be careful
how you handle the salt-shaker after this,&#8221; put in
Jack.</p>
<p>After the meal the Rovers and their chums
mingled with the other cadets and informed two
or three of what was in the wind, and as a consequence
there was quite some excitement noticeable
when a little later the crowd, with the
exception of Randy, slipped out of the school
building by a side door. Randy ran upstairs, to
appear presently on the lower landing of the fire-escape.
Here was suspended a heavy iron ladder
in such a fashion that it could be easily shoved
out so that one end would drop to the ground.</p>
<p>Soon the crowd of cadets appeared in the snow
below him, and then, with a warning to them to
get out of the way, Randy let down the ladder
and then came down himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;All clear upstairs,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Not a soul
in sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of us ought to stay on guard up there to
give warning in case it&#8217;s necessary,&#8221; announced
Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, suppose you go up,&#8221; returned Jack.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d just as soon help with the snowballs,&#8221; returned
Spouter. &#8220;But if you want me to go I&#8217;ll
do so.&#8221; And a moment later he disappeared up
the ladder and into the school building through a
window which had been thrown open.</p>
<p>The cadets on the ground found it no easy task
to raise the big snowballs up the ladder. They
tried it first with nothing but their hands, but
soon found they could do much better by dumping
a snowball into a big overcoat and then hauling
it up by the sleeves and the tail of the garment.
They worked as rapidly as possible, and
soon had eight of the snowballs raised to the
platform of the fire-escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about it? Everything clear?&#8221; questioned
Randy, as he came into the corridor where Spouter
was on guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;All clear so far,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;A few of
the fellows are in their rooms, but no one that we
are going to bother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s get those snowballs inside and distribute
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few minutes the snowballs were gotten inside
the building, and then two were rolled and
pushed over to the room occupied by Henry Stowell,
a cadet commonly called Codfish on account
of the broadness of his mouth. Luck was with
them, for the door was unlocked, so that they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
had little trouble in rolling the snowballs inside,
where they were placed one on either side of the
single bed the cadet occupied.</p>
<p>After this the cadets rolled several of the balls
to various other rooms, one being placed in the
tub of a bathroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve saved the biggest of the snowballs,&#8221; whispered
Randy. &#8220;That&#8217;s the one we must place in
Professor Duke&#8217;s room.&#8221;</p>
<p>The professor&#8217;s room was around in another
corridor, and to get to this the cadets had to roll
the big snowball directly past the top of the broad
stairs leading to the hall below. They had the
snowball in a position right at the head of the
stairs when Spouter, who was leaning over the
upper railing on guard, gave a sudden hiss of
warning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody coming!&#8221; he announced in a whisper.
&#8220;And unless I&#8217;m mistaken, it&#8217;s Professor
Duke!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh! I hope he doesn&#8217;t catch us,&#8221; returned
Gif Garrison. &#8220;Maybe we had better run for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here he comes right for the stairs!&#8221; put in
Jack, as he saw the familiar form pass a light in
the lower hall.</p>
<p>The cadets did not know just what to do, and
while they paused to consider, Professor Duke
started up the long, straight stairs. He was evidently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
in deep thought and did not look above
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run, fellows! Run!&#8221; whispered Andy excitedly,
and then, as the others started away he
attempted to follow. But the floor was wet from
the melting snow, and down he came flat on his
back, both feet hitting the big snowball squarely.</p>
<p>The movement was sufficient to send the snowball
directly to the edge of the top step. Here, as
Andy scrambled to his feet, it hovered for a moment,
then began to slide down the stairs, gathering
speed from step to step.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi! Hi! What is this?&#8221; those above heard
Snopper Duke ejaculate. And the next instant
the teacher set up a yell of alarm as the big snowball
hit him in the stomach and hurled him to one
side. Then the snowball passed on down the
stairs, slid across the lower hallway, and shot directly
through the open door leading to Colonel
Colby&#8217;s private office!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>SOMETHING ABOUT THE ROVER BOYS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Gee, we&#8217;ve done it now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The snowball knocked Professor Duke over!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi! Stop that! What do you mean? Who
did that?&#8221; came in smothered tones from Snopper
Duke, who now sat on one of the lower steps
of the stairs, holding both hands over the spot
where the big snowball had struck him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh! it struck him, all right,&#8221; whispered Gif
Garrison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And it went across the hallway into
Colonel Colby&#8217;s office!&#8221; gasped Andy, who had
scrambled to his feet and given a glance downward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Skip for it!&#8221; put in his twin brother quickly.
&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t be caught at this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The warning was not needed, for all of the
cadets were already scrambling through the corridor
and away from the stairs as rapidly as possible.
They came to a halt in front of Room 18,
that which Jack occupied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Skip inside and pretend to be reading or
studying,&#8221; said the oldest of the Rover boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we had better go to our own rooms,&#8221;
said Gif to Phil and Spouter. &#8220;And remember,
mum is the word,&#8221; he added for the benefit of
the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be some fun sooner or later, believe
me,&#8221; remarked Fred. &#8220;Andy, why did you push
that snowball downstairs on top of old Duke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do it on purpose. I slipped,&#8221; was the
answer. &#8220;But come before they start to investigate.&#8221;
And then he slipped into Jack&#8217;s room, followed
by his cousins.</p>
<p>And here let me pause for a moment to tell
something about the Rover boys and how it was
that they came to be at Colby Hall. My old
readers will not need this introduction, and, therefore,
I shall not feel hurt if they skip my words
on the subject.</p>
<p>In the first volume of this line, entitled &#8220;The
Rover Boys at School,&#8221; I introduced three brothers,
Dick, Tom, and Sam Rover, and told how
they were sent to Putnam Hall Military Academy
where they made a number of chums, including a
cadet named Lawrence Colby.</p>
<p>Passing through Putnam Hall successfully, the
three brothers next attended Brill College, and
then went into business in New York City, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
they organized The Rover Company, with offices
on Wall Street.</p>
<p>During their school days the Rover brothers
had fallen in with three very nice girls, Dora
Stanhope and her cousins, Nellie and Grace Laning.
The three young couples became married
and settled down in connecting houses on Riverside
Drive, New York City.</p>
<p>About a year following their marriage Dick
and his wife Dora became the parents of a son,
who was named John, and this son was followed
by a daughter Martha. The boy Jack, as he was
usually called, was a sturdy youth with many of
the independent qualities which had made his
father so successful.</p>
<p>Shortly after the birth of Jack, Tom Rover
and his wife Nellie came forward with a great
surprise in the form of a pair of lively twin boys,
one of whom was named Anderson and the other
Randolph. Andy and Randy, as they were invariably
called, were exceedingly active lads, in
that particular being a second edition of their
fun-loving father, Tom.</p>
<p>About the time Tom&#8217;s twins came upon the
scene, Sam Rover and his wife Grace became the
parents of a little girl, called Mary. Then, a year
later, the girl was followed by a boy who was
christened Fred.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>Residing side by side, the younger generation
of Rover boys, as well as their sisters, were
brought up very much as one large family. At
first they were sent to private schools in the Metropolis,
but the boys, led by Andy and Randy,
showed such an aptitude for fun and horseplay
that their parents were compelled to hold a consultation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to send those kids to some strict
boarding school&mdash;some military academy,&#8221; said
Dick Rover.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s right,&#8221; his brother Tom had
answered. &#8220;Although how my wife is going to
get along without having the twins around is more
than I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that time Lawrence Colby, the Rovers&#8217; former
Putnam Hall chum, was at the head of a
military academy called Colby Hall. To this institution
Jack, Fred, and the twins were sent.
And what they did upon their arrival there is told
in detail in the first volume of my second series,
entitled &#8220;The Rover Boys at Colby Hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>The military school was located about half a
mile from the town of Haven Point on Clearwater
Lake. At the head of the lake was the
Rick Rack River, running down from the hills
and forests beyond. The school consisted of a
large stone building facing the river, and close by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
was a smaller building occupied by Colonel Colby
and his family and some of the professors, and at
a short distance were a gymnasium, a boathouse,
and likewise bathing pavilions.</p>
<p>On arriving at Colby Hall the younger Rovers
found several of their friends awaiting them, including
Dick Powell, usually called Spouter because
of his occasional desire to make long
speeches, and Gifford Garrison. Spouter and Gif
were the sons of Songbird Powell and Fred Garrison,
men who in their boyhood days had been
close chums of the older Rovers while at Putnam
Hall. The Rovers made a number of other
friends, and, likewise, a few enemies, many of
whom will be heard of later.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Colby Hall was located about
half a mile beyond Haven Point, and on the
opposite side of the town was Clearwater Hall, a
boarding school for girls. During a panic in a
motion picture house the Rover boys became acquainted
with several girls from Clearwater Hall,
including Ruth Stevenson, May Powell, Alice
Strobell, and Annie Larkins. They discovered
that May was Spouter Powell&#8217;s cousin, and the
whole crowd of young people soon became friends.
Later on Mary and Martha Rover became pupils
at the girls&#8217; school.</p>
<p>Ruth Stevenson had an old uncle, Barney, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
one day, while out hunting, the Rover boys did
the old man a great service. For this he invited
them to spend some winter holidays with him,
which they did, as related in another volume,
called &#8220;The Rover Boys on Snowshoe Island.&#8221;</p>
<p>On this island the boys met two of their former
enemies, Nappy Martell and Slugger Brown, as
well as Asa Lemm, a discharged teacher of Colby
Hall. The Rovers exposed a plot against old
Uncle Barney and caused the hunter&#8217;s enemies to
leave Snowshoe Island in disgust.</p>
<p>Some of the boys hoped they had seen the last
of Nappy and Slugger, but Jack was doubtful;
and how those two unworthies turned up again
to cause more trouble is related in the book entitled
&#8220;The Rover Boys Under Canvas.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was at the time of the annual encampment,
and at an election of officers Jack was made captain
of Company C and Fred made first lieutenant.</p>
<p>While the Rover boys were at Colby Hall the
great war in Europe opened. When the call for
army volunteers came Dick Rover and his brother
Sam lost no time in enlisting, and as soon as he
could get away Tom Rover followed; and the
three fathers of the boys went into the trenches
in Europe to do their duty for Uncle Sam.</p>
<p>During the following winter at Colby Hall Gif
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
Garrison received a letter from an uncle, stating
that he and his chums might use a bungalow up
in the woods. Gif at once invited the Rover boys
and Spouter to become his guests, and what a
glorious time the lads had is related in a volume
entitled &#8220;The Rover Boys on a Hunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>The return of the older Rovers from Europe
at the conclusion of the great war in which they
had served gallantly brought something of a surprise.
Dick Rover had saved the life of a man
from Texas, and in return had been given the
deed to some property located between Texas and
Oklahoma and said to be in a region containing
oil. He decided to go to Texas and Oklahoma
to investigate, and the four boys begged to go
along. How they went to the oil fields and what
stirring adventures they had there are related in
detail in the volume preceding this, called &#8220;The
Rover Boys in the Land of Luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here they fell in again with Nappy Martell,
Slugger Brown, and another good-for-nothing lad
named Gabe Werner, and also with a man named
Carson Davenport, who did his best to do Dick
Rover great harm. Davenport and some of his
cohorts were finally placed under arrest. As a
result of this Gabe Werner&#8217;s father took hold of
some wells that were being sunk by the Davenport
crowd. But in the end he and the Martells
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
and the Browns lost a great deal of their money,
so that they were left almost penniless.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a terrible blow for those three families,&#8221;
said Dick Rover, when this occurred. &#8220;It will
make Mr. Werner quite a poor man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t particularly wish them any hard
luck,&#8221; remarked Andy. &#8220;Just the same, I guess
Nappy, Slugger, and Gabe got what was coming
to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before going down to Texas and Oklahoma
the Rover boys, while along the Rick Rack River
during a violent storm, had succeeded in rescuing
a man and his son who were caught between some
rocks and a drifting tree in the middle of the
swiftly flowing stream.</p>
<p>The man, John Franklin, was exceedingly
thankful for what had been done for him, and so
was his son Philip. It developed later that the
Franklins owned a tract of land in Texas. And
when it was discovered that the tract inherited by
Dick Rover from the soldier in France was practically
worthless, Jack&#8217;s father made an arrangement
to work the Franklin place on shares. Two
oil wells were bored, and both of these paid handsomely,
making the Rovers richer than ever and
also placing a substantial amount in the bank to
John Franklin&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know I can scarcely believe it&#8217;s true,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
Phil Franklin had said to the Rover boys. &#8220;Why,
my father will have more money than he ever
dreamed of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re as glad as you are, Phil,&#8221; Jack had answered.
&#8220;Glad on your account as well as our
own. Now maybe you can go to Colby Hall with
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that would be immense!&#8221; Phil had returned
with pleasure. And that fall he had joined
the crowd at the military academy and soon made
for himself a host of friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, I never thought going to school could be
so nice,&#8221; declared Phil Franklin to the Rover
boys one day. &#8220;I always considered going to
school a hardship. But this is bang-up in every
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you haven&#8217;t made any enemies yet,
Phil,&#8221; remarked Fred. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that Nappy
Martell, Slugger Brown, and Gabe Werner all
hailed from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve met only one fellow that I don&#8217;t like,&#8221; returned
Phil Franklin. &#8220;That&#8217;s a fellow who came
in the day I did, a big, tall, lanky chap named
Lester Bangs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean Brassy Bangs,&#8221; broke in Randy.
&#8220;I know that fellow only too well. I had quite a
set-to with him one day in the gym.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For a new cadet he&#8217;s certainly pretty forward,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
answered Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad he isn&#8217;t a member
of my company. If he was I think I&#8217;d have to
call him down more than once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess Colby Hall is bound to have its bullies,&#8221;
Andy had remarked on hearing this. &#8220;No
sooner do we get rid of one group than another
appears. They seem to grow like weeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the fall there had been the usual football
season at the military academy, and the boys
had acquitted themselves quite creditably, winning
seven games out of twelve. Then had come the
brief Christmas holidays. And following this
the lads had settled down once more into the
grind, resolved to do their best at their lessons.
But, of course, they were only boys, and they had
to have their fun, and occasionally the fun went
a little too far and brought forth rather disastrous
results, as we have just seen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>WHAT THE SNEAK TOLD</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I certainly didn&#8217;t think that snowball would
go down the stairs so easily,&#8221; remarked Andy,
when he and the other Rovers were alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep quiet,&#8221; warned Jack, who had remained
at the partly-opened door. &#8220;I want to
hear what takes place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is outrageous, simply outrageous!&#8221; they
heard in Snopper Duke&#8217;s high-pitched voice.
&#8220;How dared you roll such a snowball down these
stairs? And how came you to get that snowball
up there anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Professor, but I don&#8217;t know what
you&#8217;re talking about,&#8221; answered another voice;
and at this Jack gave a slight start, for he recognized
the words as coming from Brassy Bangs.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that? You do not know anything
about the big snowball that just came hurtling
down these stairs?&#8221; stormed Professor Duke.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. I just reached the top of the stairs,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
answered Brassy Bangs. &#8220;I came out of my room
not ten seconds ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about this, Stowell?&#8221; went
on the professor, who had now come slowly to
the top of the stairs, followed by Professor Grawson,
who had come out of Colonel Colby&#8217;s private
office where he had been looking over some reports
when the big snowball had landed with a
thump against the desk at which he had been
seated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? What do you mean?&#8221; stammered the
youth who was known to the cadets as Codfish
and who had always been more or less of a sneak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody just rolled a big snowball down the
stairs. It struck me and nearly knocked me flat,&#8221;
returned the irate teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and it rolled all the way into the private
office,&#8221; added Professor Grawson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about any snowballs,&#8221;
said Codfish. &#8220;I noticed the floor was all wet and
I wondered what it meant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw some fellows rushing around the corner,&#8221;
came from Brassy Bangs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who were they?&#8221; demanded Snopper Duke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way did they go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That way,&#8221; and Brassy pointed out the direction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>By this time the two professors had reached the
top of the stairs and Grawson was looking at the
water marks on the polished floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is where they brought that big snowball
in,&#8221; he remarked, pointing to the track that led
to one of the windows. &#8220;They must have brought
it up on the fire-escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are several other tracks. I think we had
better follow them,&#8221; returned Snopper Duke
quickly.</p>
<p>The track leading to the bathroom was most in
evidence, and the two professors quickly discovered
the big snowball resting in the bathtub.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evidently they put this here to have some more
fun with,&#8221; announced Professor Grawson grimly.
&#8220;Well, it won&#8217;t do much harm here. I&#8217;ll turn on
a little hot water and it will soon melt and run
off,&#8221; and he turned on the faucet as he spoke.</p>
<p>From the bathroom the two professors, followed
by Codfish and Brassy, followed the water
trail into a room occupied by several students who
were particularly uppish and whom the Rovers
did not like, and here some more of the snowballs
were found.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is another trail,&#8221; announced Professor
Duke, and in a moment more had thrown open
the door leading to Stowell&#8217;s bedroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here! what does this mean?&#8221; stammered Codfish,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
as, after the light had been turned on, he and
the others saw the two big snowballs resting on
either side of the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stowell, you must have had something to do
with this,&#8221; cried Snopper Duke savagely.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. Not at all, sir,&#8221; answered the sneak
in a trembling voice. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know a thing
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come from just now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I came up the back stairs. I was just coming
through the corridor when I heard the noise
and came to see what it meant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The back stairs, eh?&#8221; put in Professor Grawson.
&#8220;What were you doing on the back stairs
this time in the evening?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I was down in the kitchen.&#8221; And now
Codfish grew pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what called you to the kitchen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I was hungry, and so I asked one of the
servants for something to eat.&#8221; And now Codfish
was fairly whining.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! didn&#8217;t you have any supper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. But I wasn&#8217;t feeling extra well just
then and I didn&#8217;t eat very much, and that made
me hungry afterwards. And, oh, say! I guess I
can tell you something about those snowballs,&#8221;
and Codfish&#8217;s face lit up suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When I was passing through the little entryway
that leads into the kitchen I happened to
glance out of the window and I saw four or five
fellows down at the foot of the fire-escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What were they doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I looked at them they were just talking
among themselves. I only looked for a moment
because I was in a hurry to get to the kitchen
and get back again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you recognize any of the cadets?&#8221;</p>
<p>At this direct question, Codfish hesitated and
showed that he felt far from comfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to tell on anybody,&#8221; he whined.
&#8220;If I do that they&#8217;ll be sure to lick me later on&mdash;I
know they will!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You tell me who they were and I&#8217;ll see to it
that they do not harm you,&#8221; put in Professor
Duke quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only saw two of the fellows real plainly,&#8221;
answered Stowell. &#8220;They were standing in the
light from one of the windows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who were they? Tell me! I want no
nonsense now,&#8221; and Snopper Duke caught the
sneak firmly by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ouch! Please don&#8217;t hurt me!&#8221; cried Codfish,
in added alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then answer me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The two fellows I recognized were Captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
Jack Rover and his cousin, Lieutenant Fred
Rover.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t know the others?&#8221; put in Professor
Grawson.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. I didn&#8217;t see them well enough.
They were all in the shadows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll investigate this,&#8221; cried Professor Duke.
&#8220;Stowell, you come with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t make me come!&#8221; cried the
sneak. &#8220;They&#8217;ll almost kill me if they find I gave
them away!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They sha&#8217;n&#8217;t touch you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know what they&#8217;ll do,&#8221; moaned Codfish.
He had not forgotten how the Rover boys
had sided with him on more than one perilous
occasion, and it scared him half to death to think
what they might do when they discovered how
meanly he was acting.</p>
<p>But there was no help for it, and Codfish was
marched along between the two professors, with
Brassy and a number of other cadets, who had
been attracted by the noise and the talk, following.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the four Rover boys had listened to
as much of the conversation as they could catch.</p>
<p>&#8220;They went into Codfish&#8217;s room&mdash;they are following
the trail of the water on the floor,&#8221; announced
Jack.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the other fellows are coming out and
coming upstairs,&#8221; announced Fred. &#8220;Let us go
out too and see what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ll accuse Codfish of this,&#8221; remarked
Randy, with a grin.</p>
<p>The four Rovers had just come out in the corridor
and been joined by Gif, Phil, and Spouter
when they found themselves suddenly confronted
by Professor Duke, with Professor Grawson and
poor Codfish directly behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is your work, is it?&#8221; demanded Snopper
Duke, glaring angrily at Jack and Fred in
turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;To what do you refer, Professor?&#8221; asked
Jack, as calmly as he could.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know well enough, Captain Rover. It is
useless for you to deny it,&#8221; stormed the angry
teacher. &#8220;You and your cousins here are responsible
for bringing those big snowballs into the
school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says so?&#8221; questioned Fred. At the same
time he gave Codfish a look that made the sneak
want to hide himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind who says so. We know it to be
a fact,&#8221; stormed Snopper Duke. &#8220;Will you kindly
let me know what you mean by such outrageous
conduct?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it so very outrageous, Professor, to bring a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
few snowballs into the school?&#8221; questioned Randy
innocently.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve often brought snow into the school,&#8221;
put in Andy. &#8220;We used to use it for making a
sort of home-made ice-cream&mdash;with milk and
sugar and a little flavoring, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Colby or Captain Dale never ordered
us to leave the snow outdoors,&#8221; added Fred, and
at this there was a snicker from among a number
of the cadets who were gathered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not listen to such nonsense,&#8221; stormed
Snopper Duke. &#8220;You four brought those snowballs
into this school, and some of you kicked that
snowball down the stairs on top of me,&#8221; he added,
glaring at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to say right now, Professor Duke, that
that big snowball went downstairs by accident,&#8221;
answered Andy, feeling that there was no help for
it and that he must make a clean breast of the matter.
&#8220;We were rolling it down the corridor when
all at once I slipped in a puddle of water and both
my feet struck the snowball and sent it on its
way down the stairs. But we didn&#8217;t mean to send
it down; I can give you my word on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; stormed Snopper Duke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m telling you the truth, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps Rover didn&#8217;t mean to send the snowball
downstairs,&#8221; put in Professor Grawson mildly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
As a general thing he sided with the cadets
and they had little difficulty in getting along with
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Grawson, I was the one to suffer through
this outrageous trick,&#8221; fumed Snopper Duke.
&#8220;And you will kindly permit me to handle the affair.
These four cadets are guilty and must be
punished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree it is more your affair than mine, Mr.
Duke,&#8221; returned the other teacher. &#8220;But don&#8217;t
you think it would be wise to let the matter rest
until Colonel Colby comes back from the city?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all! Not at all! These young rascals
must be taken in hand, and at once. Otherwise
our authority in this institution will go to
pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this moment there was a movement among
the students who had collected in the corridor,
and Gif and Spouter stepped forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Professor Duke,&#8221; said Gif. &#8220;But
I had as much to do with bringing those snowballs
upstairs as anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so did I,&#8221; added Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I was in on the deal, too,&#8221; came from
Phil Franklin, as he too stepped forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;What? All of you?&#8221; demanded Snopper
Duke, eyeing them coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can assure you we meant no great harm,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
continued Spouter. &#8220;We were only going to have
a little fun among ourselves and with our fellow-cadets&mdash;that
is, mostly,&#8221; he added somewhat
lamely, as he remembered what had been said
about placing some of the snowballs in the teacher&#8217;s
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were any others implicated in this despicable
piece of business?&#8221; demanded Professor Duke,
looking around at the assembled cadets. &#8220;Answer
me at once!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no reply to this, the cadets simply
looking at each other questioningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all here, sir,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;There were
no others.&#8221; And he and his cousins gave their
chums a warm look to show they appreciated
their coming forward to take a share of the
blame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven of you, eh?&#8221; was the teacher&#8217;s sour
comment. &#8220;A fine piece of business, truly.&#8221; He
thought for a moment. &#8220;Come with me, all of
you, and we&#8217;ll see what damage has been done
down in the office.&#8221;</p>
<p>The assembled cadets made a passageway, and
through this filed the Rovers and their chums
with Professor Duke following close on their
heels. Professor Grawson remained behind to
talk to Stowell.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll kill me for this&mdash;I know they will!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
whined Codfish. And now he was on the verge
of tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the Rovers will touch you, Stowell&mdash;I
don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re that class of boys,&#8221;
answered Professor Grawson. &#8220;Come. I&#8217;ll go
to your room with you and help you throw those
snowballs out of the window.&#8221; He had not forgotten
that he had been a schoolboy himself once,
and he had small sympathy for such a sneak as
Henry Stowell.</p>
<p>Down in Colonel Colby&#8217;s private office it was
found that the big snowball had done little damage
outside of wetting a couple of the rugs. What
was left of the snowball had been gathered up by
Pud Hicks, the janitor&#8217;s assistant, and now he
was mopping up the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the rugs and dry &#8217;em in the laundry,&#8221;
said Hicks. &#8220;I think they&#8217;ll be all right by morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You cadets remain here until I return,&#8221; said
Professor Duke, when Hicks was ready to depart.
And then he went outside and in the hallway
held a whispered conversation with the janitor&#8217;s
assistant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re in for it,&#8221; said Jack to his cousins
and his chums.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose they&#8217;ll do with us?&#8221;
questioned Phil.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few minutes Snopper Duke returned, and
there was a grin of satisfaction in his eyes as he
faced the cadets.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will all follow me,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
show you what can be done in this school to cadets
who act as outrageously as you have acted.
Come! March!&#8221; and he led the way out of the
private office.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>PRISONERS</h3>
</div>

<p>In one of the wings of the school building
there was located a room about twelve feet square
with one window which was barred, and this, as
my old readers know, was known officially as the
school guardroom or prison. Jack and Fred had
once been prisoners in this guardroom on a
charge that was afterwards proved to be false.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! I wonder if he&#8217;s going to take us to the
guardroom?&#8221; whispered the youngest of the
Rovers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how he can crowd seven of us into
that small room,&#8221; answered Randy. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s
only got one cot in it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Duke led the way through the corridor
and up the broad stairs. In the meanwhile
Professor Grawson had ordered the other cadets
to their rooms, so there was no one at hand to
witness what was taking place.</p>
<p>Arriving on the second floor, Snopper Duke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
led the way into another corridor and then up a
somewhat narrow stairway leading to the third
floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! I wonder where he&#8217;s going to take us
now?&#8221; questioned Fred in wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is certainly a new wrinkle,&#8221; declared Gif.</p>
<p>The third floor was but dimly lit until the professor
turned on more light. Then he turned into
a little side corridor at the end of which was located
a long, narrow room which, during the previous
year, had been used by some of the hired
help but which was now unoccupied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will remain in this room until I have a
chance to communicate with Colonel Colby,&#8221; said
Professor Duke, as he marched the cadets in.
&#8220;And remember! I want no cutting up here. I
want you to remain perfectly quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long shall we have to stay here?&#8221; questioned
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will depend on what Colonel Colby has
to say about it,&#8221; was the sharp answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you expect us to stay here all night?&#8221; demanded
Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will have to stay here unless Colonel Colby
gets back from the city, and I think that hardly
likely to-night,&#8221; answered the teacher. &#8220;Now remember!
No noise and no horseplay or I&#8217;ll do
something that you won&#8217;t forget in a hurry,&#8221; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
with this admonition he walked out of the room,
closing and locking the door after him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; cried Fred, as all of the others started
to talk at once. And going to the door, he
listened intently, and so did the others, and they
heard Snopper Duke pass through the little corridor
and down the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone, all right enough,&#8221; remarked Phil
Franklin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you know about this, anyhow!&#8221;
cried Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s treating us like a lot of children,&#8221;
declared Andy angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he has any right to keep us out
of our regular rooms,&#8221; came from his brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, he took the right,&#8221; answered
Jack grimly. &#8220;And what is more, he seems to
have the best of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t have if we break down that door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll have an easy job of it
breaking down that door,&#8221; put in Spouter. &#8220;I
happened to notice that there was not only a
regular lock on it, but also a top bolt. You&#8217;d
have to smash the whole door to get out. But
it certainly is a despicable piece of business,&#8221;
Spouter continued. &#8220;And at the first opportunity
we have we&#8217;ll have to lay the whole case before
Colonel Colby. I&#8217;m sure when he has verified
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
our report, and gone into the various merits of the
case, he will make a finding that will be in accordance
with&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! Spouter can spout even if he is a prisoner,&#8221;
burst out Randy. &#8220;Better get up on a
chair, Spouter, and make a regular speech about
it,&#8221; he continued, grinning.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a new experience for me,&#8221; remarked
Phil, with a smile. &#8220;I never thought I was going
to be put in jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can hardly call it being put in jail, Phil,&#8221;
answered Jack. &#8220;In a military academy it is quite
common for a cadet, when he has broken the
rules and regulations, to be placed in the guardhouse,
just the same as he is placed in the guardhouse
in the regular army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought maybe they&#8217;d make us do what they
call police duty,&#8221; said the boy from Texas. &#8220;One
fellow told me that while he was in the training
camp he overstepped the regulations and they
made him peel potatoes until he was sick and
tired of seeing them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they do that too,&#8221; put in Fred. &#8220;You
might have to do something like that if we were
at the annual encampment. But while the school
session is on all they do is to lock you up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys found that the long narrow room contained
two double beds and two cots, as well as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
couple of bureaus, several stools, and a table. At
one end was a small bathroom and a clothing
closet. There were three small windows in a
row, all looking out on the snow-covered fields
behind the school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve got a place to sleep, anyhow,&#8221; announced
Jack. &#8220;Although three of us will have
to sleep in one of the beds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much in the way of covering,&#8221; remarked
Gif, who had been making an investigation.
&#8220;Just one thin blanket on each bed. And that
radiator is not letting out heat enough to warm
a cat,&#8221; he added, as he placed his hand on the
one small radiator of which the long bedroom
boasted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, we can keep on our uniforms if
we want to,&#8221; declared Randy. &#8220;And who knows
but what Colonel Colby may come back at any
minute, and then I&#8217;m almost certain that he&#8217;ll let
us go back to our own rooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will unless old Duke cooks up some dreadful
story against us,&#8221; came from his brother.
&#8220;You can bet he&#8217;ll make out as black a case
against us as he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But I think Professor Grawson will
have something to say too,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;And he
has always been a very fair-minded man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why Colonel Colby took on such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
man as Snopper Duke,&#8221; declared Spouter. &#8220;He&#8217;s
every bit as bad as Asa Lemm was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve got to hand it to him for being a
very well educated man,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;And he
certainly knows how to teach when he&#8217;s in the
humor for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think a man who is as harsh-minded
as he is ought to be a teacher,&#8221; was Gif&#8217;s comment.
&#8220;He can&#8217;t get a cadet to do his best if he&#8217;s
forever nagging at him. Now, if I was a teacher,
I&#8217;d do my best to gain my pupils&#8217; confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a pause, and presently Andy began
to chuckle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, he certainly did look funny when that
big snowball hit him in the stomach and nearly
knocked him over,&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could you see that when you were on
your back?&#8221; questioned Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I managed to flop over and look down
the stairs just in time. He was some sight, believe
me. It&#8217;s a wonder he didn&#8217;t go over backward
to the floor below. I don&#8217;t know what
saved him. He must have grabbed the banisters
just in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t really blame him for being mad. I
think maybe I&#8217;d be mad myself,&#8221; said Gif.
&#8220;However, let&#8217;s drop that. What are we going
to do? Go to bed?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that there is anything else to do,&#8221;
answered Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to do something to keep warm,&#8221; declared
Andy, and suddenly turned a somersault
over one of the beds. Then he began to box with
his brother, and the two spun around from one
end of the room to the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here! you stop that,&#8221; warned Fred. &#8220;You
know what Duke said. You keep on and he&#8217;ll
put us down in the cellar or some other worse
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this the seven cadets became more quiet,
and, sitting as close as possible to the little radiator
which gave forth only a mite of warmth, they
discussed the situation for half an hour longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s another one against Codfish,&#8221; declared
Randy. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s guilty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he had some reason for saying what he
did,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;He had to clear his own skirts
after they found those two big snowballs in his
room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same, Jack, you know well enough
hardly any other fellow in the school would have
squealed,&#8221; cried Randy. &#8220;Codfish always was a
sneak, and I guess he always will be, no matter
what some of the other fellows do for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, look here! I thought you fellows told
me that Captain Dale was in charge of this school
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
whenever Colonel Colby was absent,&#8221; burst out
Phil suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; answered Jack. &#8220;He was in
charge all the time the colonel was in the regular
army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t Professor Duke put this up
to the captain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Captain Dale is away on a little vacation,&#8221;
announced Gif. &#8220;He won&#8217;t be back until
some time next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where did Colonel Colby go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They said he had gone to the city,&#8221; answered
Fred. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know what they mean by
that. They may mean Boston, or New York, or
some smaller place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The radiator is growing stone cold,&#8221; declared
Gif, who had his hands on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll you bet old Duke didn&#8217;t turn the heat
off?&#8221; broke in Andy quickly. &#8220;It would be just
like him to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess about the only thing we can do is to
go to bed,&#8221; announced Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you had better do it with your uniform
on, then,&#8221; said Spouter. &#8220;Because I&#8217;m not going
to bed with the windows closed, and it&#8217;s going to
be beautifully cold by and by.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of the cadets had been accustomed to sleeping
with the windows of their bedrooms open.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
But they had also been accustomed to plenty of
bed clothing, and knew they would probably suffer
with the scant quantity of quilts now provided.</p>
<p>However, they had to make the best of it, and
in the end did little else but take off their shoes
and coats and then wrap themselves in the blankets
as best they could. Of course, there was some
horseplay in which even Phil Franklin indulged.
But on the whole the cadets kept rather quiet, for
they did not want to make matters worse than
they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last time Randy and I were home our dad
laid down the law good and plenty,&#8221; announced
Andy. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve got to do something towards
toeing the mark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid Brassy Bangs and a lot of the other
fellows will have the laugh on us for this,&#8221; remarked
Fred, as he turned in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, you can&#8217;t have fun without paying
the piper once in a while,&#8221; was Jack&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>It grew colder during the night, and on rising
to cut off some of the air that was blowing over
him, Fred noticed that it had begun to snow. The
fine hard particles were drifting into the room,
and he called the attention of some of the others
to this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. Let it snow in if it wants to,&#8221;
grumbled Randy sleepily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>But some of the others demurred to this, and
presently one of the windows was closed entirely
and the others left open only a few inches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, talk about Greenland&#8217;s icy mountains!&#8221;
exclaimed Gif, on arising a little after seven
o&#8217;clock. &#8220;Some coldness, if you ask me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said it!&#8221; declared Jack, as he got up and
walked across the floor to where the radiator was
located. &#8220;Cold as ice!&#8221; he announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you leave it turned on?&#8221; questioned
Randy quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then old Duke must intend to freeze us out!&#8221;
exclaimed Fred. &#8220;What do you know about
that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s a mean piece of business,&#8221; answered
Andy. &#8220;Gee! why, we might all catch our
death of cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having washed themselves, the cadets lost no
time in donning the clothing they had taken off on
retiring. Then they continued to walk around
the narrow room in order to keep their blood in
circulation. It was now about eight o&#8217;clock, and
they wondered if they would get any breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;A hot cup of cocoa or coffee wouldn&#8217;t go bad,&#8221;
remarked Spouter. &#8220;Not to say anything about
ham and eggs, hot muffins, or a few other things
on the side.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yum, yum! don&#8217;t mention them,&#8221; groaned
Andy. &#8220;I feel hollow clean down to my shoes.
I didn&#8217;t have any too much supper, and I was depending
on having a few crackers I had in my
closet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I left an apple on my bureau,&#8221; declared
Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I had two doughnuts stored away to take
to bed with me,&#8221; came from Fred.</p>
<p>The boys heard the cadets below assembling
for roll call and the short morning parade, and
then heard them march into the mess room of
the Hall for breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;My! but I wish I was downstairs right now,&#8221;
declared Randy. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do a thing to that
breakfast table!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ll bring our breakfast to us,&#8221; suggested
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they do you can bet there won&#8217;t be any too
much of it&mdash;if old Duke has anything to do with
it,&#8221; returned Gif grimly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>BY THE FISHING-POLE ROUTE</h3>
</div>

<p>Another half hour went by, and the boys confined
in the room on the third floor of the school
building became more and more impatient.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they won&#8217;t give us any breakfast at
all,&#8221; said Phil Franklin presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they don&#8217;t there&#8217;ll be war,&#8221; declared Andy.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t stand for being starved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None of us will stand for that,&#8221; put in Gif
grimly. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t believe Duke will dare do
it. You must remember he will have all the other
teachers to contend with. They have the same
rights here as he has.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but Professor Grawson turned this affair
over to Duke,&#8221; was Fred&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was because old Duke was the only one
to really suffer through what we did,&#8221; answered
Jack.</p>
<p>Another fifteen minutes passed, and then those
in the room heard footsteps outside. The door
was unlocked and Professor Duke appeared, followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
by Pud Hicks and Bob Nixon and two of
the mess-room waiters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, did you behave yourselves during the
night?&#8221; demanded the teacher, as he glanced
sharply from one to another of the cadets, all of
whom eyed him curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did, sir,&#8221; answered Phil, who was nearest
to the door.</p>
<p>Leaving those who had accompanied him at
the door so that none of the cadets present might
escape, Snopper Duke strode into the room and
looked around suspiciously, even going so far as
to glance into the bathroom and the clothing
closet. As was the custom during the school
term, the cadets had put the beds and the cots in
order, and also arranged the chairs and other
furniture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Duke, I&#8217;d like to ask something. Do
you know we have no heat in here?&#8221; questioned
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Growing boys like you don&#8217;t need too much
heat&mdash;it makes them lazy,&#8221; responded the teacher
tartly. &#8220;You will be warm enough after you
have had your breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we go downstairs now and get it?&#8221; asked
Andy quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. You are to have it up here. I have had
it brought up for you,&#8221; was the answer. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
then Professor Duke motioned for the two waiters
to come in.</p>
<p>They carried two trays covered with napkins,
and these they deposited on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Colonel Colby come back yet?&#8221; questioned
Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will know quickly enough when he
comes,&#8221; was the teacher&#8217;s reply. And then he
motioned the waiters out of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor, do you think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Bob
Nixon. But the teacher caught the Hall chauffeur
by the arm and pushed him out into the
hallway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind now, Nixon,&#8221; he broke in hastily.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk matters over downstairs.&#8221; And
thereupon he closed and locked the door once
again, and the cadets heard him and all of the
others go below.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose he brought Hicks and
Nixon up here for?&#8221; questioned Randy, when
they were left alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, unless he thought we might try
to break out, and if so he would have them along
to stop us,&#8221; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he thought the cold and waiting for
breakfast would make us desperate,&#8221; suggested
Gif. &#8220;However, now they&#8217;ve gone, let&#8217;s see what
they have brought us to eat.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>Eagerly the seven cadets whipped away the
napkins that covered the two trays. They gave
one look, and then a cry of disappointment arose.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this the limit!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Black coffee and bread without butter!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And mush with nothing but a little molasses
on it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And no sugar in the coffee, either!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk about your prison fare!&#8221; groaned Andy.
&#8220;I think this takes the cake!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mention cake and I&#8217;ll murder you!&#8221; burst
out Fred. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you speak of ham and
eggs, lamb chops, fried potatoes, coffee cake with
raisins in it, and things like that while you&#8217;re
at it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow! Fred for the water faucet!&#8221; exclaimed
Jack, and got his cousin by the arm and made as
if to run him into the bathroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold up! I&#8217;ll be good!&#8221; pleaded the youngest
Rover. &#8220;But, say! doesn&#8217;t looking at these
two trays make you weary in the bones?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, the coffee is hot,&#8221; declared
Spouter, as he tasted it. &#8220;And we might as well
drink it before it gets cold. It will help to warm
us up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon the seven cadets fell to eating, and
soon every particle of the scanty breakfast furnished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
to them had disappeared. They grumbled,
however, as they ate, and continued to
grumble after the repast was finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite sure Colonel Colby wouldn&#8217;t treat
us like this,&#8221; declared Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly did much better by Fred and me
when we were placed in the guardroom,&#8221; declared
Jack. &#8220;We got as good a meal as we ever
had served to us in the mess hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing short of a crime not to turn the
heat on,&#8221; said Fred, who was examining the radiator
again. &#8220;Just as cold as ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; cried Randy suddenly.</p>
<p>All did so, and heard a faint knocking on the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is that?&#8221; questioned Jack, moving to the
portal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Jack?&#8221; came in Fatty Hendry&#8217;s
voice. The stout youth was whispering through
the keyhole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Fatty. What brought you up here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got wind that you fellows were being fed
scanty rations,&#8221; answered Fatty. &#8220;How about
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true, all right enough.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;OUR FRIENDS ARE ON THE JOB!&#8221; CRIED FRED, DELIGHTEDLY.<br />

<p>&#8220;Well, Dan Soppinger, Walt Baxter and myself
got our heads together and we managed to
make up a bundle of food for you. Just watch
the window on your right,&#8221; continued the stout
youth, and then tiptoed away.</p>
<p>Wondering what their friends intended to do,
the seven cadets crowded to the window in question
and opened it wide. It was still snowing,
and through the thickly-flying flakes they presently
saw the end of a fishing pole on which was
tied a bundle done up in a pillow case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Our friends are on the job,&#8221; cried
Fred delightedly, as the bundle was slipped from
the end of the fishing pole and hauled into the
room. Then he looked out of the window and
saw at a little distance the face of Dan Soppinger
at another window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it all right, did you?&#8221; demanded Dan, as
he hauled in the fishing pole.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sure did, Dan; and much obliged to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Colonel Colby come back yet?&#8221; questioned
Jack, looking over his cousin&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. And there is no telling when he&#8217;ll come
back,&#8221; answered Dan. &#8220;He sent word that his
business might keep him away for several days.&#8221;
Then Dan spoke to some one behind him, and
continued in a low voice, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go now, or
they&#8217;ll catch us. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>The imprisoned cadets closed the window
again and then placed the bundle on the table and
opened it. They found it contained a rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
jumbled collection of buttered bread, cheese, the
knuckle of a boiled ham, a small glass full of
jelly, a square of pound cake, three bananas, a
couple of oranges, several apples, a small bag of
lump sugar, and a can of condensed milk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some collection, all right enough,&#8221; declared
Spouter, as they surveyed it. &#8220;I guess they
grabbed up anything they could lay their hands
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They must have heard we had black coffee
without sugar,&#8221; put in Fred. &#8220;Too bad we were
in such a hurry. We might have feasted in great
shape off of this collection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind. The sugar and condensed milk
may come in handy later,&#8221; answered Jack.</p>
<p>The boys divided some of the fruit, and then
made themselves a few sandwiches, and with this
topped off the scanty breakfast they had previously
consumed. They placed the rest of the
things on the top shelf of the closet and folded
up the pillow case carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to send that back the first chance
we get,&#8221; declared Fred. &#8220;Otherwise some cadet
is going to catch it when his room is inspected.&#8221;</p>
<p>With nothing to do, the cadets found the time
drag heavily. They looked around the room for
some reading matter, but found nothing outside
of some newspapers which had been placed on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
shelves of the closet. These were old sheets, and
contained nothing which they cared to peruse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! we&#8217;re going to have some heat, anyhow,&#8221;
cried Randy, about eleven o&#8217;clock. &#8220;Hear
the radiator cracking?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was right, and soon the radiator became
moderately warm. This did not, of course, warm
the room very thoroughly, but it took the chill
off and made it more comfortable than it had been.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet a cooky that some of the others made
old Duke turn the heat on,&#8221; declared Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;Either that or else some of our chums turned
it on when he wasn&#8217;t watching,&#8221; answered Jack.
Some time later they found out that Bob Nixon
had turned on the heat unbeknown to Snopper
Duke. It was also learned that Professor Grawson
and Professor Brice knew nothing about the
heat having been turned off.</p>
<p>About half-past twelve Snopper Duke appeared
again, this time with one of the under teachers
and two of the waiters. The under teacher had
his arms full of books.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had some of your text books brought
up here,&#8221; explained Professor Duke. &#8220;There is
no sense in your wasting your time here doing
nothing. I want you to study the same as if you
were attending your classes. I have also had
your dinner brought up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you expect us to study in a cold room?&#8221;
questioned Jack. He had thrown one of the small
bed covers over the radiator and added a book or
two so that the teacher might not notice that it
was warm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not discuss that point with you, Rover,&#8221;
was Snopper Duke&#8217;s sharp reply. &#8220;You can eat
your dinner, and then go at your studies.&#8221; And
thereupon he directed the two waiters to deposit
the fresh trays on the table and take the old ones
away. Then the seven cadets were locked up as
before.</p>
<p>In comparison, the dinner was just as scanty
as the breakfast had been. For each pupil there
was a small boiled potato, almost cold, a few
lima beans, a small slice of roast beef, and one
slice of unbuttered bread. There were also several
paper drinking cups, to indicate that the
cadets might drink all the water they cared to
draw from the faucet in the bathroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regular miser&#8217;s lunch,&#8221; was Andy&#8217;s comment,
as he surveyed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; answered Fred. And then he
added dryly: &#8220;What are we going to use that
sugar and condensed milk on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the condensed milk will go fine on the
bread,&#8221; put in Spouter. &#8220;I used to like condensed
milk sandwiches.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you can eat the lump sugar for dessert
if you want to,&#8221; put in Jack.</p>
<p>All began to eat, and in the midst of the meal
they heard another knock on the door. This time
Ned Lowe was there, one of their chums who was
a great singer and banjo player.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be on the watch for the beautiful fishing
pole,&#8221; sang Ned in a low voice. &#8220;Hurry up. We
can&#8217;t stay up here very long.&#8221;</p>
<p>All leaped for the window, and a few minutes
later the fishing rod came once more into view,
this time with another bundle attached to it. They
held the end of the pole while they detached the
bundle and fastened upon it the empty pillow case.
The new bundle was in a large paper flour bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is where we are going to have a regular
feast!&#8221; cried Jack with satisfaction. &#8220;Just look!
Almost half a boiled tongue, a quart jar of hot
coffee, some boiled sweet potatoes, and half an
apple pie. I declare I don&#8217;t see how they managed
to get hold of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re certainly looking out for us,&#8221; answered
Spouter.</p>
<p>With this addition to the food already on hand,
the boys started in to have a real good dinner.
They were enjoying it thoroughly and cracking
all kinds of jokes when they suddenly heard a
commotion in the corridor outside.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve caught you, have I?&#8221; they heard Snopper
Duke exclaim. &#8220;What business have you up here,
anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t doing any harm, Professor,&#8221; came
in the voice of Dan Soppinger.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that you have behind your back?
Give it to me this instant,&#8221; went on the teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! that&#8217;s Dan Soppinger, and he&#8217;s got himself
into trouble!&#8221; exclaimed Jack, in alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really didn&#8217;t mean to do any harm,&#8221; the imprisoned
cadets heard Dan answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that you are trying to hide? Give it
to me!&#8221; There was a brief silence, and then
those in the room heard the teacher continue: &#8220;A
pumpkin pie and almost a pound of cheese!
Where did you get those things, Soppinger? And
what were you going to do with them? Come,
answer me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to know, I was going to try to
get them to those fellows you locked up,&#8221; answered
Dan Soppinger, in desperation. &#8220;I heard
you were just about starving them to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Starving them to death? Stuff
and nonsense! They are getting all that they
need, and it&#8217;s not for you to interfere in my business,&#8221;
went on Snopper Duke, his high-pitched
voice rising still higher in anger. &#8220;You should
be down in your classroom. Give me those things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
and go downstairs at once. I&#8217;ll attend to your
case later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! poor Dan is certainly in hot water,&#8221;
whispered Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Duke must have been spying on him,&#8221;
said Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;ll come in here and see how matters
are going!&#8221; cried Spouter excitedly. &#8220;It might
not be a bad thing to get all that extra food out
of sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had scarcely spoken when they heard Professor
Duke at the door. An instant later the
portal was thrown open and the teacher stepped
in. His eyes swept the trays and the plates of
food the cadets were holding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! So this is what is going on, eh?&#8221; he
stormed. &#8220;Having food brought in on the sly,
eh? Well, I&#8217;ll see that that is stopped! You&#8217;ll
go without your supper for this!&#8221; And then,
after a few more words, he stormed out of the
room, banging the door behind him and locking
it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A TOUCH OF MYSTERY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Now I reckon we are worse off than we were
before,&#8221; remarked Jack, as the assembled cadets
looked at each other in consternation.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he cuts off our supper the best thing we
can do is to save this grub,&#8221; declared Randy.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to go on short rations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when we feel real hungry we can turn
to our school books for consolation,&#8221; added his
twin brother. &#8220;Gee! but doesn&#8217;t this take the
cake?&#8221; And picking up his algebra he threw it
at Phil. The boy from Texas dodged, and the
algebra hit the wall behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t start a rough-house, Andy,&#8221; remonstrated
Jack quickly. &#8220;We&#8217;re in deep enough as
it is. Please don&#8217;t forget that Fred and I are
worse off than any of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you make that out?&#8221; demanded Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we are officers, and are supposed to
be models for the rest of the cadets.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! I forgot that,&#8221; said Gif. &#8220;That&#8217;s too
bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>It must be admitted that the cadets were far
less cheerful while finishing their meal than they
had been a few minutes before. They ate somewhat
sparingly, and placed what was left of the
food in an out-of-the-way corner under one of
the cots.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use of taking chances,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Duke
may come in here and search the closet for rations
when he gets the dirty dishes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose we might as well spend our
time studying,&#8221; came from Spouter presently.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to learn our lessons, no matter if we
are prisoners. Otherwise later on we&#8217;ll be marked
down for that, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad that poor Dan had to be caught with
that pumpkin pie and cheese,&#8221; groaned Randy.
He was particularly fond of the pies turned out
by the Hall cooks.</p>
<p>Making themselves as comfortable as they
could around the radiator, the seven cadets began
to study. Thus an hour passed, and then
came more footsteps in the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another visitor,&#8221; said Jack, looking up.</p>
<p>When the door was thrown open they expected
to see Snopper Duke or one of the other professors,
and they were, therefore, much surprised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
when Colonel Colby stepped into the room. The
master of the Hall was alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Attention!&#8221; called Jack sharply&mdash;for this had
been arranged between the cadets earlier in the
day&mdash;and thereupon all of the cadets leaped to
their feet and saluted.</p>
<p>This action came somewhat as a surprise to the
master of the school, and just the faintest flicker
of a smile passed over his features. Then he
closed the door behind him and came forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sorry to learn that all of you have
been breaking the rules of this institution,&#8221; said
Colonel Colby, in an even tone of voice. &#8220;Captain
Rover, I would like to have your version of
the affair if you care to make a report.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I can make much of a report,
Colonel,&#8221; answered the young captain, his
face flushing. &#8220;We brought the snowballs into
the school, and that is all there is to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about sending that big snowball
down the stairs on top of Professor Duke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was an accident, sir, and I was responsible
for it,&#8221; broke in Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;An accident? Professor Duke is quite certain
it was done by design.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is mistaken, sir,&#8221; continued Andy, and
then in a few words related exactly how the accident
had occurred.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about the snowballs that were
placed in the rooms of Stowell, Besser, Lunn
and in the bathroom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We only meant it for a little fun, Colonel,&#8221;
pleaded Fred. &#8220;Of course, I realize now that
maybe we went a little too far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly did go too far, Lieutenant
Rover. And I am especially surprised to find you
and Captain Rover mixed up in anything of this
sort. I expect the officers of the cadets to set a
good example.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking you might say that, Colonel
Colby,&#8221; put in Jack quickly. &#8220;And I should have
thought of it before I went into the affair. But
we were having such fun outside snowballing,
and like that, that we got deeper into it before
we gave it a second thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we really didn&#8217;t know that we couldn&#8217;t
bring any snow into the school,&#8221; put in Phil rather
lamely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such an explanation won&#8217;t go here, Franklin.
I expect my students to have more common sense
than that. Of course, it may have been nothing
but a boyish prank, and if you can give me your
word that the snowball which went down the
stairs and hit Professor Duke was not aimed
at him deliberately, I shall feel inclined to let the
matter pass.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Colonel Colby, will you really do that?&#8221;
questioned Fred eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please remember we&#8217;ve been punished already,&#8221;
put in Spouter. &#8220;Locked up like a lot
of criminals, and the radiator turned off until we
almost froze to death!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The radiator turned off?&#8221; questioned the
owner of the school. &#8220;It is hot enough now,&#8221; he
added, as he placed his hand upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it wasn&#8217;t before,&#8221; answered Gif, and gave
the particulars. As he did this Colonel Colby&#8217;s
face became a study.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will look into that,&#8221; he said, and then
walked over to one of the cots and also to one
of the beds and inspected the thin coverings. &#8220;I
trust none of you caught cold?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I did catch a little cold,&#8221; answered
Spouter, and began to cough, for what he said
was true.</p>
<p>After this Colonel Colby talked to the cadets
for fully ten minutes, trying to show them that
what they had done was not what he expected of
them. He was kind almost to the point of being
fatherly, and made several remarks which caused
the boys to do considerable thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid some of you lads do not like Professor
Duke,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I am afraid you consider
him rather quick-tempered and irritable.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he certainly isn&#8217;t as nice as most of the
other teachers,&#8221; declared Randy flatly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He always seems to be waiting for a chance
to get in on a fellow,&#8221; broke out Fred. &#8220;In
some ways he&#8217;s even worse than Asa Lemm was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s a splendid teacher, I will say that for
him,&#8221; declared Jack. &#8220;Only, the way he sometimes
jumps on a fellow is terrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t like to have you boys compare
Professor Duke with that scalawag, Asa Lemm,&#8221;
declared Colonel Colby. &#8220;Lemm had a good education&mdash;if
he hadn&#8217;t had I should not have engaged
him to teach here&mdash;but he was not the honest
and upright man Snopper Duke is. I will admit
that at times he is quick-tempered, but,
believe me, boys, he has good reasons for it&mdash;or,
at least, there is quite some excuse for his acting
that way at times. I do not feel like discussing
his personal affairs with you, but you will be
doing a real act of kindness if at times you don&#8217;t
notice his actions when he seems rather sharp. I
am quite sure he doesn&#8217;t always mean it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course, if there&#8217;s some reason&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is quite a reason, Captain Rover. But,
as I said before, I do not care to discuss Professor
Duke&#8217;s personal affairs further. Only, if I
were one of you boys, I should go very slow in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
judging him. And now to come back to this
present affair: I have had a talk with Professor
Duke and I will have another talk this evening,
and, all told, I think you have been punished
enough. So we will call the matter off and you
can return to your classrooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, Colonel Colby,&#8221; cried
Jack, and, starting forward, he offered his hand,
and the master of the school shook it warmly.
Then all of the other cadets came forward to do
likewise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t punish those other fellows
for getting some extra food up to us,&#8221; said Fred,
as he and Andy brought out the hidden things
and placed them on one of the trays. &#8220;They only
tried to do us a good turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may rest assured, Rover, that I shall treat
them only as they deserve,&#8221; answered Colonel
Colby, and led the way downstairs. Here the
cadets separated, each to pay a brief visit to his
own room before going down to the classrooms
on the lower floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what Colonel Colby meant when he
said Duke had reasons for being irritable?&#8221; remarked
Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; answered Jack
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s suffering from some sickness,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
suggested Fred. &#8220;Perhaps he ought to have an
operation and hates to have it done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s worried about money matters,&#8221;
came from Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was certainly something worth while or
Colonel Colby wouldn&#8217;t have been so serious about
it,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;Gee! I&#8217;m sorry if I misjudged
him, if there is really something wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe Colonel Colby would caution
us if it wasn&#8217;t so,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;And after this
I&#8217;m going to give Duke as much consideration as
I possibly can.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys had been told to go to their classrooms,
but this was hardly necessary, for they
had just about presented themselves when the
afternoon session of the school came to an end.
Then they followed some of their friends down
to the gymnasium, where they were at once surrounded
and asked to give the particulars of what
had happened to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a great deal,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;And
first of all I want to know what was done to Dan
and the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Colonel Colby read us a little lecture,
that&#8217;s all,&#8221; answered Walt Baxter, one of the
cadets. &#8220;He told us we had no right to take any
of the food without asking for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I offered to pay for it,&#8221; put in Ned Lowe,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
&#8220;and so did Dan. But the colonel said that
wasn&#8217;t the point. That he wanted the discipline
of the Hall maintained.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he say anything about Professor Duke?&#8221;
questioned Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he told us something,&#8221; continued the
youngest Rover, and then related what had been
said on the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that squares with something I once
heard,&#8221; cried Walt Baxter. &#8220;I met Professor
Duke down at the barn one day where he was
waiting to have Nixon drive him down to town.
The professor was walking around, wringing his
hands and muttering to himself. He looked all
out of sorts, and he said something that sounded
to me like &#8216;I don&#8217;t see how I can do it! I don&#8217;t
see how I can really attempt it!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what do you suppose it was that bothered
him, Walt?&#8221; questioned Jack curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know. I watched him walk
up and down and wring his hands. And then he
took a notebook out of his pocket and began to
study some of the figures in it. Then Nixon
came along with the auto, and he jumped in and
rode off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that sure is a mystery,&#8221; declared Randy.</p>
<p>This news concerning Snopper Duke gradually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
spread throughout the school, and many of the
boys watched the teacher curiously. In the meantime
Colonel Colby had a conference, not only
with Duke, but also with Professor Grawson;
and when the classes opened the next day Jack
and the others found themselves treated just as if
nothing out of the ordinary had occurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Colby said he would let the matter
pass, and I guess he&#8217;s going to keep his word,&#8221;
remarked Fred.</p>
<p>There was only one boy who remained
troubled, and that was Codfish. He avoided the
Rovers and the others as much as possible, often
running away at the sight of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Codfish is just about scared stiff,&#8221; remarked
Randy. &#8220;He knows he got himself in wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a poor fish he is,&#8221; answered his twin.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon a number of the boys
obtained permission to visit the town and attend
the moving picture performance if they so desired.
Jack had telephoned to his sister, and
Martha had answered that probably a number of
girls from Clearwater Hall would be in town at
the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve got something to tell you, too, Jack,&#8221;
said Martha over the wire. &#8220;Something I&#8217;m
sure you&#8217;ll be interested in hearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you tell me now?&#8221; he replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this isn&#8217;t something to tell over a public
telephone,&#8221; his sister answered.</p>
<p>The snowstorm had come to an end, and it
was clear and bright overhead when the four
Rovers and some of the others tramped to Haven
Point. Here, at the railroad station, they met
Martha and Mary, and also Ruth Stevenson,
May Powell, and several other girls from the
academy.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are your eyes feeling, Ruth?&#8221; questioned
Jack anxiously, as he walked side by side with
the girl on the way to the moving picture theater.
As my old readers know, Ruth had once suffered
dreadfully through getting some pepper into her
eyes, and it had been feared that she might go
blind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my eyes are quite all right again, Jack,&#8221;
answered the girl. &#8220;Sometimes they feel the least
bit scratchy. But I bathe them with a solution
the doctor gave me and then they feel quite natural.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad to hear that,&#8221; Jack returned
warmly. For of all the girls who were friends
of his sister he liked Ruth the best.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, there was a very good
show on that afternoon, and as a consequence a
crowd had assembled to obtain tickets of admission.
Randy went ahead to get all the tickets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
needed, and while he did this Martha plucked her
brother by the coat sleeve and drew him a little
to one side.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this you&#8217;ve got to tell me, Martha?&#8221;
questioned the young captain in a whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about a fellow at your school&mdash;a chap
named Lester Bangs,&#8221; replied the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean the fellow we call Brassy
Bangs! What about him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He and one or two of his particular chums
have been up to Clearwater Hall three times.
They took some of the girls out in a sleigh they
hired, and that Bangs did his level best to get
Ruth to go along. And now he has invited her
to attend some kind of a party next week,&#8221; was
Martha&#8217;s reply, words which for some reason he
could not explain even to himself cut Jack to the
heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>SOMETHING ABOUT A SLEIGHRIDE PARTY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What kind of a party is it, Martha?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, except that it&#8217;s somewhere out
of town and some of the girls and fellows are
going to the place in sleighs. I wasn&#8217;t asked to
go, and I got the information in a roundabout
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Ruth hasn&#8217;t said anything to you about
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word. But I&#8217;m sure she received this
Lester Bangs&#8217; invitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you think she may accept it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not, Jack. Because I don&#8217;t like Bangs.
He wears such showy clothing and jewelry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the reason we call him Brassy&mdash;he is
brassy in looks and brassy in manner. He&#8217;s
just as much of a hot-air bag as Tommy Flanders,&#8221;
went on the young captain, referring to
an arrogant youth who the summer before had
pitched for Longley Academy and been knocked
out of the box.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it queer, he put me in mind of Flanders?&#8221;
whispered Martha. &#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t have any
trouble with him, Jack.&#8221; And then, as some of
the others came closer, the private conversation
had to come to an end.</p>
<p>While in the moving picture theater Jack sat
with Ruth beside him. They occasionally spoke
about the scenes presented to them and also about
school matters in general, but not one word was
said by either about the party Martha had mentioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Falstein certainly gets good pictures,&#8221; remarked
the girl, when the performance had come
to an end and the crowd of young people was
moving out of the theater. &#8220;They&#8217;re just as good
as one can see in the big cities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re the same thing, only he gets them a
little later,&#8221; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like the comic pictures better than anything,&#8221;
declared Andy. &#8220;I hate those serious
ones. They&#8217;re generally so awfully mushy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Andy Rover, how you talk!&#8221; cried Alice
Strobell. &#8220;I think that picture they showed today
of Life in a Big City was perfectly grand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially where the heroine sobbed herself
to sleep over the sewing machine in her garret
room,&#8221; went on Andy, with a snicker. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t
that just the tear-bringer?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care! It was just as true to life as
it could be,&#8221; answered Alice sturdily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe,&#8221; was the airy return of the fun-loving
Rover. &#8220;Come to think of it, I never did
run a sewing machine in a garret room with the
snow blowing through a busted window. I&#8217;d
rather sit in the shade of the old apple tree reading
a good book and getting on the outside of
some ripe pears,&#8221; he continued, and at this there
was general laughter.</p>
<p>As was their custom, the young folks drifted
from the theater to a nearby candy and ice-cream
establishment. Here they split up into various
groups at some tables in the rear. Of course, the
boys insisted on treating the girls, and there was
quite a discussion over what each would have.
Martha and Mary had paired off with Gif and
Spouter, and Fred and the twins were with some
of the other girls, and this left Ruth and Jack by
themselves.</p>
<p>Several times the young captain wanted to
bring the conversation around to the question of
the party that had been mentioned. But every
time he checked himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you going to say?&#8221; questioned
Ruth, when he caught himself once. &#8220;You act
as if you had something on your mind of special
importance, Jack.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all! Not at all!&#8221; he returned hastily.
&#8220;How are you getting along with your studies,
Ruth? Do your eyes interfere much with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a great deal. But, of course, I have to be
more or less careful. But I&#8217;m doing finely, so
the teachers say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have an election of officers
soon,&#8221; continued the young captain. &#8220;Some of
the fellows are urging me to run for major of
the battalion. Ralph Mason is going to drop out,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack! why don&#8217;t you run?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want me to run, Ruth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course! if there&#8217;s any chance of getting
it, and I don&#8217;t see why there shouldn&#8217;t be,&#8221;
she returned quickly.</p>
<p>Her manner was so intimate that once again
he was on the point of mentioning the party.
But then he shut his teeth hard and pretended to
be interested in something taking place at the
other tables.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you could win the election if
you tried?&#8221; Ruth continued, after looking at him
questioningly for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess I&#8217;d have as good a chance as any
one in command. Of course, there are a number
of other officers who would have as good a chance
as I&#8217;d have. But I&#8217;m not altogether sure that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
I want to be major. If I held that office
Colonel Colby would expect me to toe the mark
all the time just as an example to the others.
Even as it was, he didn&#8217;t like to have me as a
captain and Fred as a lieutenant mixed up in that
snowball affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but, Jack! think of the honor of being
major of the battalion,&#8221; cried the girl. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure
Martha and your folks will be very proud of
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you be proud, Ruth, if I should win
the position?&#8221; he asked in a low tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course&mdash;we all would,&#8221; returned the
girl, her face flushing slightly. &#8220;I always like to
see my friends make something of themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ruth&#8217;s tone was cordial enough, and once again
Jack was on the point of switching the talk to
the party. But now some of the young folks had
finished, and the little gathering began to break
up and he and Ruth were surrounded by the
others.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to do some shopping,&#8221; declared
Mary, when they were out on the sidewalk. &#8220;So
we can&#8217;t remain with you boys any longer.&#8221; And
a few minutes later the crowd separated, the girls
hurrying in one direction and the cadets in another.</p>
<p>&#8220;You let me know if you hear any more about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
that party,&#8221; whispered Jack, on parting from his
sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>On starting back for the Hall Jack paired off
with Fred and purposely lagged behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear anything about a party in which
Brassy Bangs was interested?&#8221; he asked of his
cousin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary said that Brassy was getting up some
sort of party, to come off either Thursday or
Friday of this week. The crowd is going somewhere
in two big sleighs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t say where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she say who was going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as she knew the crowd of fellows consisted
of Brassy and two or three of his chums
at the Hall and some young fellows around
town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what about the girls, Fred?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They asked Jennie Mason and Ida Brierley
to go and a number of the other girls from Clearwater.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they ask May?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary wasn&#8217;t sure. But she rather thinks that
May and Ruth both got an invite, although in
some kind of roundabout way. Did Ruth say
anything to you about it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word. But Martha did. She, too,
thought Ruth had an invitation, but she didn&#8217;t
mention May.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if May and Ruth will go?&#8221; questioned
the youngest Rover. He was almost as
chummy with Spouter&#8217;s cousin as Jack was with
Ruth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know, Fred. But I do know
I&#8217;d hate to see either of them going out with such
a fellow as Brassy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a shame to have any of those girls
associate with him!&#8221; burst out Fred indignantly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s not in their class at all&mdash;he&#8217;s altogether too
loud and flashy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly sports a lot of cheap jewelry,&#8221;
was Jack&#8217;s comment. &#8220;And that suit of clothes
that he had on when he first came to the Hall was
a scream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go around to the livery stable and see if
we can find out something about the party.&#8221;</p>
<p>The place Fred had in mind was located on a
side street less than a block away, and it did not
take the two young officers long to reach it. They
found the livery-stable keeper out, but one of his
assistants came forward to see what they wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Waxy,&#8221; cried Jack cordially, for he
had met the young fellow many times before.
&#8220;How are you these days?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Fine as a spider&#8217;s web,&#8221; answered Waxy, with
a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand you&#8217;re going to use your two big
sleighs for a party this week for some of our fellows?&#8221;
went on the young captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, both sleighs are hired for Thursday or
Friday night,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;But you could
get &#8217;em for any other night you might want,&#8221;
went on Waxy, with an eye to business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the party to be held?&#8221; questioned
Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly. They&#8217;re to go about
twelve miles out of town, so I was told.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some young fellows from town helping to
get it up, I believe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Tom Drake, Bill Fenny, Joe McGuire,
Ted Rosenblatt, and a bunch of others are interested.
They&#8217;ll have one high old time, you
believe me,&#8221; went on the livery-stable keeper&#8217;s assistant,
with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather a lively bunch, are they?&#8221; questioned
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;About as lively as this town affords.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder some of our fellows are going
with them,&#8221; was Fred&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;ll be all right. There won&#8217;t be anything
out of the way,&#8221; put in Waxy hastily, afraid
that he had said too much. &#8220;They&#8217;ll have a lively
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
time, but everything will be perfectly all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; answered Jack, and then, after a few
more words with the assistant, the two cadets hurried
off after their chums.</p>
<p>&#8220;If McGuire and Rosenblatt have anything to
do with that party it will certainly be a lively
one,&#8221; said Fred, on the way to the school.
&#8220;They&#8217;re the liveliest fellows this town affords.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be any kind of a party for our girl
friends to attend,&#8221; remarked Jack. &#8220;I certainly
hope May and Ruth don&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we ought to warn them, Jack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we did that somebody might say we were
sore because we weren&#8217;t invited, Fred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it. But it&#8217;s a shame, just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We might let Martha and Mary know what
we found out, and then they might put a flea in
the ears of the other girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>It must be confessed that Jack was rather sober
that night and all day Sunday. He could not
get the coming party out of his mind, and he
wondered constantly whether Ruth would really
accept the invitation which had been extended to
her. Along with a number of other cadets he
attended church in town, but, owing to the fact
that it had begun to snow again, none of the girls
from Clearwater Hall were present at the services.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I might as well call Martha up on the
&#8217;phone,&#8221; he told Fred, Sunday evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; was his cousin&#8217;s reply. &#8220;And don&#8217;t
forget to mention May.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the young captain had his sister on the
wire he learned a number of things that surprised
him not a little. It seemed that the matter of the
coming sleighride party had been rather freely
discussed at Clearwater Hall, and a number of the
pupils there were divided on the question as to
whether to participate in the affair or not. Jennie
Mason, Ida Brierley, and four or five others
were in favor of accepting, while others had
either declined or were noncommittal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the girls have gotten almost into a
fight over it,&#8221; said Martha. &#8220;It&#8217;s the liveliest
thing that has happened in this school in a long
while. I believe if the discussion keeps up none
of the girls will be allowed to go, even though two
married ladies from the town are to go along as
chaperones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear anything further about Ruth or
anything about May?&#8221; questioned Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word. Of course, not having been invited
myself, I didn&#8217;t care to question either of
them for fear they might think I was just a bit
jealous, or something like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think they ought to go to any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
such party,&#8221; answered Jack, and then told what
he and Fred had learned at the livery stable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of Joe McGuire and also heard of
Ted Rosenblatt!&#8221; exclaimed Martha. &#8220;I certainly
shouldn&#8217;t want to be seen in their company.
I&#8217;ll have to mention this to some of the
others.&#8221; And here the conversation had to come
to an end.</p>
<p>On Monday morning Jack met Brassy Bangs in
one of the corridors and noticed that the loud-spoken
youth looked at him rather speculatively.
Nothing, however, was said, and the young captain
entered one of the classrooms and was soon
deep in his studies. That evening, however,
Brassy Bangs and two of his chums were missing
from their usual places at one of the mess-hall
tables.</p>
<p>&#8220;They got permission to go to town. I suppose
they went to make further arrangements
about that big sleighing party,&#8221; remarked
Randy.</p>
<p>To show that he meant to do his best as captain
of Company C, Jack put in a full day on
Tuesday drilling his command and in the classrooms.
As a consequence that evening found him
pretty well worn out from his duties. Yet he had
some studying he felt he must do, and so announced
he was going to sit up for a while after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
his cousins, who occupied rooms on both sides of
him, had retired.</p>
<p>The young captain was hard at work doing
some examples in geometry when there came a
sudden sharp rap on his door. Thinking that one
of his school chums had come to have a word with
him before retiring, he threw the door open and
found himself confronted by Brassy Bangs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to have a few words with you, Jack
Rover!&#8221; cried the loud-mouthed cadet savagely.
And then closing the door he advanced upon the
young captain in anything but a friendly manner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>A FIGHT AND A CHALLENGE</h3>
</div>

<p>Jack Rover could see that Brassy Bangs was
laboring under great excitement. The youth who
loved to dress in such a showy manner was red
of face and his eyes glittered in a manner calculated
to make any one quail before him.</p>
<p>But the young captain of Company C was not
going to quail, and he stood his ground and
looked the other youth squarely in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want a few words, eh?&#8221; he said coldly.
&#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know well enough what brought me
here!&#8221; cried Brassy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a good mind to wipe
up the floor with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not fighting just now, Bangs. But don&#8217;t
forget that I can defend myself if it&#8217;s necessary,&#8221;
answered the young captain quickly. And then
he added: &#8220;Now say what you&#8217;ve got to say or
get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay as long as I please,&#8221; blustered the
showy youth. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fine piece of business you&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
been in&mdash;trying to belittle me and my chums in
the eyes of the girls at Clearwater Hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you came here to talk about the young ladies
from Clearwater the sooner you get out the better,&#8221;
answered Jack, his face flushing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought you were pulling off a fine stunt,
didn&#8217;t you, when you talked to Ruth Stevenson
about me?&#8221; sneered Brassy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t said a word to Miss Stevenson about
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know better, Jack Rover. You went to her
and some of the other girls and told them that
my chums and I were no good, and that the sleighride
party we and some other fellows were getting
up was going to be the wildest thing that
ever took place at Haven Point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re entirely mistaken, Bangs. And the
sooner you get out of here the better it will please
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you dare deny that you hauled us over
the coals with those girls at Clearwater Hall?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I decline to discuss the matter any further with
you,&#8221; answered the young captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Rover! you can&#8217;t ride any high horse
like that with me,&#8221; blustered Brassy. &#8220;You and
your cousins and some of the other fellows did
your best to queer our whole sleighing party, and
you&#8217;ve got to take the consequences!&#8221; And now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
Brassy Bangs doubled up his fists and tried to
look more dangerous than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Bangs! if you don&#8217;t stop your noise
and get out of here I&#8217;ll put you out,&#8221; returned
Jack, in a low but firm voice. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any
fight with you, but I want you to understand that
I can hold up my end every time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like pie you can! You put on a big front
as a captain, but I know your sort well enough!
You can&#8217;t pull the wool over my eyes! You went
to the girls&#8217; school and shot off your mouth, and
you are going to take the consequences!&#8221; and
without further ado Brassy Bangs stepped forward
and aimed a heavy blow at Jack&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Had the fist landed as intended, Jack might
have been knocked flat. But the young captain
had not been in athletic training for several years
for nothing, and he dodged quickly. Brassy was
carried forward, so that his arm shot over Jack&#8217;s
shoulder and his body came in contact with the
young captain&#8217;s arm. The next instant Jack had
him by the back of the collar and was holding
him at arm&#8217;s length.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you get out of here!&#8221; he cried, and tried
to drag Brassy toward the door.</p>
<p>Of course the other youth squirmed, and in an
instant there was a rough and tumble scuffle.
Jack was pushed against the wall, and retaliated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
by forcing Brassy backward over a chair. Then
the two spun around the room, upsetting a stand
containing a number of books.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! what&#8217;s going on here?&#8221; came a voice
from one of the side rooms, and Fred appeared.
He had been in bed and was attired only in his
pajamas.</p>
<p>Jack and Brassy were so wrought up by this
time that neither paid attention to the interruption.
Nor did they take notice when another door
opened and Andy and Randy came into view.
Brassy managed to break away and land a blow
on Jack&#8217;s arm, and in return received a crack in
the chin which sent his head backward and all but
unbalanced him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! it&#8217;s a regular fight,&#8221; burst out Andy. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know Brassy was here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither did I,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you
call us, Jack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t give me time,&#8221; answered the young
captain. &#8220;He accused me of getting him into
trouble at Clearwater Hall, and then pitched into
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix you!&#8221; yelled Brassy, who was now
almost beside himself with rage. &#8220;I&#8217;ll fix you!&#8221;
and he made another lunge for Jack.</p>
<p>But the blow he intended to deliver fell short,
and before he could recover the young captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
came at him with a crack in the ear, followed by
another on the cheek, and these caused Brassy to
stagger into a corner where he held fast to a
chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you fellows will have Colonel Colby here
in another minute,&#8221; warned Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care who comes!&#8221; bellowed Brassy
recklessly. &#8220;But see here, I&#8217;m not going to fight
four of you!&#8221; he went on sullenly, as he glared
from one to another of the Rovers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There won&#8217;t be any more fight!&#8221; cried Jack,
who had no desire to be brought up before the
master of the school again. &#8220;Fred, open that
door!&#8221; And then, as the youngest Rover did so,
he added to his opponent: &#8220;Now get out of here
before I throw you out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t throw me out!&#8221; blustered Brassy.
But then, as Jack advanced on him threateningly,
he made a sudden spring for the door and ran
out into the corridor. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to fight
four to one. But just wait&mdash;this isn&#8217;t ended yet,&#8221;
he went on, and then disappeared.</p>
<p>Fred closed the door again, and he and the
others gathered around Jack, who was panting
from his unexpected exertions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, but he looked mad!&#8221; was Randy&#8217;s comment.
&#8220;What was it all about?&#8221;</p>
<p>In as few words as possible the young captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
explained the situation so far as he was able.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brassy must have gone over to Clearwater
Hall and there got the idea that you were queering
that proposed party,&#8221; was Fred&#8217;s comment.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad if the girls are wise to what is
going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better chew this over in the morning,&#8221; admonished
Andy. &#8220;The thing now is to get into
bed and put out the lights. One of the professors
may be up here any minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>This advice was considered good, and with
lightning-like rapidity the room was placed in
order and the others retired again, leaving Jack to
undress and go to bed as quickly as possible. A
little later one of the monitors came through the
hall, but none of the Rovers was disturbed.</p>
<p>It was not until two days later that the Rovers
heard the particulars of what had occurred at
Clearwater Hall. Then they learned that, unknown
to any of the girls, one of the teachers
had been delegated by Miss Garwood, the head
of the academy, to make a quiet investigation
concerning the proposed sleighing party. And
when this teacher had found out who were on
the committee of arrangements, Miss Garwood
had forbidden any of the young ladies to participate.
When this became known, Brassy Bangs
had at once concluded that Jack&mdash;and perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
some of his relatives and friends&mdash;was responsible
for what had occurred. The party had been
called off.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s called off,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; returned Fred. &#8220;But, believe me,
Jack, Brassy will have it in for you after this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t hear anything about what girls
intended to go, did you?&#8221; put in Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard Jennie Mason, Ida Brierley, and Nettie
Goss mentioned. That&#8217;s all,&#8221; answered Jack.</p>
<p>He would have given a good deal to have known
what was the real attitude of Ruth and May toward
the party. But, as before, neither he nor
Fred felt inclined to make any direct inquiries.</p>
<p>&#8220;It almost looks as if Brassy had expected
Ruth to go with him,&#8221; murmured the young captain
to himself, when he was alone that night.
And it must be confessed that the thought made
him feel quite gloomy.</p>
<p>After this incident matters ran along smoothly
for a week or more at the Hall. During that
time the snow commenced to melt and almost before
the cadets knew it, it had disappeared entirely.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile there was constant talk of the
election for officers that was to take place. Ralph
Mason, the major of the school battalion, was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
about to leave, as was also one of the captains,
so there would be first an election to fill these vacancies
and then another election in case one or
both vacancies were filled by those who were already
acting as officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really think you ought to try for the majorship,&#8221;
said Gif to Jack. &#8220;You certainly have
done well as a captain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be very nice, Gif,&#8221; was Jack&#8217;s reply.
&#8220;But I feel sometimes as if I ought to give
some of the other fellows a show.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they may not want it,&#8221; answered Andy.
&#8220;Look at me, for instance. I don&#8217;t want to be an
officer, and neither does Randy. And Gif here
would rather continue at the head of our athletics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but you fellows are not the whole school,&#8221;
declared Jack, with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know lots of fellows who want you to run,&#8221;
declared Spouter. &#8220;And you say the word and I&#8217;ll
go around and do a lot of electioneering for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The matter was talked over a good many
times, and fully twenty of the cadets came to
Jack and told him they wanted him to run for
the office of major. And finally he consented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, here&#8217;s news!&#8221; burst out Fatty Hendry,
one day, as he joined his chums. &#8220;It&#8217;s the richest
thing ever,&#8221; and he grinned broadly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; questioned Dan Soppinger, who
was present.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just heard through Teddy Brown that
Brassy Bangs wants to run for major. That he
even told one of the professors about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he can&#8217;t do that!&#8221; declared Fred quickly.
&#8220;That is, not without special permission from
Colonel Colby or Captain Dale. The major is
always chosen from among the captains and lieutenants,
or those who have been officers before.
That is, if there is any one to pick. It&#8217;s only
Colonel Colby or Captain Dale who can declare
the election open to any one. You can&#8217;t put a
fellow who has just learned to handle a gun to
march at the head of the battalion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course Brassy didn&#8217;t know that, and
he wouldn&#8217;t believe it until Captain Dale explained
it to him. And then he said he thought he ought
to be able to hold the position because he was one
of the best shots in the school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he certainly is a good shot,&#8221; declared
Fred. &#8220;I saw him shooting at a target one day
and he certainly made some marvelous hits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He comes from the West&mdash;from some place
where everybody knows how to shoot,&#8221; declared
Walt Baxter. &#8220;I heard him telling some of the
fellows about it one day. He said he had learned
to ride and to shoot when he was only six or seven
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
years old. And he can ride, all right enough, too.
I saw him do it one day when I was on the road
back of the Point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think a few of us can do a little
shooting,&#8221; declared Andy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that
out of a possible twenty-five points Fred once
made nineteen and Jack eighteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I remember that,&#8221; put in Ned Lowe.
&#8220;That was the time Lew Barrow scored twenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and the time I scored the whole of ten,&#8221;
chuckled Andy. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; he added
proudly. &#8220;I guess I brought down my share of
small game when we went hunting.&#8221;</p>
<p>The talk concerning Brassy Bangs wanting to
run for the office of major was true, and the
cadet was much disgusted when he found that
the regulations of the Hall forbade this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can beat any one of them at shooting,&#8221; he
grumbled to Paul Halliday, one of his particular
cronies and the fellow who had aided in trying to
get up the sleighing party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you can,&#8221; was Halliday&#8217;s quick reply.
Then he went on: &#8220;Say, Lest, why don&#8217;t you
challenge Jack Rover and his cousin Fred to shoot
against you? You can show &#8217;em up in great
shape. It would be better than fighting them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; announced Brassy promptly, for
the idea was one that appealed to him. &#8220;I&#8217;ll shoot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
against them with either pistols or rifles, just as
they may choose. I&#8217;ll show &#8217;em up for a couple
of dubs when it comes to handling firearms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk!&#8221; broke in Billy Sands, another
of Bangs&#8217; chums. &#8220;You say the word and
Paul and I will take the challenge to the Rovers
right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All provided Colonel Colby or Captain Dale
will permit the contest,&#8221; said Brassy sourly.
&#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s another one of the things their
dirty rules won&#8217;t allow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The matter was talked over for a while longer,
and the three boys went off to interview Captain
Dale. He listened to them with a smile, and then
nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you can have a contest of that sort
if you desire, Bangs,&#8221; he said presently.</p>
<p>Following this the challenge to Jack and Fred
was promptly issued. It, of course, came as a
surprise to the Rovers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought not to dirty our hands with a fellow
like Bangs,&#8221; declared the young captain to
Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we can&#8217;t afford to refuse, Jack!&#8221; cried
his cousin. &#8220;If we did the fellows in the Hall
would think we were afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>And thereupon the challenge was accepted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE SHOOTING CONTEST</h3>
</div>

<p>It was decided that the shooting contest should
take place the next day.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t give us much time to practice,&#8221;
grumbled Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;We might as well have it over with,&#8221; answered
Jack. &#8220;There is no use of allowing it to
interfere with our lessons or with the coming
election for officers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think we can shoot as well as Brassy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can try, Fred. From all reports he&#8217;s quite
a wonderful shot. It seems he comes from a place
where everybody is used to firearms.&#8221;</p>
<p>It had been decided to hold the contest on the
regular range back of the school grounds. Fred
and Jack had been in favor of rifles, but the boy
from the West had voted in favor of pistols. As
a consequence, Captain Dale had told them the
contest would be divided into two parts of a possible
fifteen points each, the first part to take place
with pistols and the second with rifles.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you fellows have just got to snow Brassy
under!&#8221; cried Randy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t leave him a leg to
stand on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy enough to say, Randy,&#8221; answered
Jack. &#8220;But it isn&#8217;t so easy to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, and I was only fooling. However,
do your best and make some kind of showing
against that loud-mouthed fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the contest Jack and
Fred received permission to take rifles and pistols
and do a little practicing with the firearms. They
went out alone, not wishing to be disturbed by
any one.</p>
<p>As they were crossing the fields they saw a
figure coming from a side road. The person approaching
had the cape of his overcoat drawn up
tightly around his throat and wore his cap pulled
down well over his forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow looked like Brassy Bangs,&#8221; declared
Fred, as the distant figure leaped over a
hedge and disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly did look like Brassy,&#8221; answered
his cousin. &#8220;But what in the world could he be
doing out so early in the morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he was practicing a little on his own
account.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t have any gun with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. But he might have a pistol.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He never struck me as a fellow who would
get up so very early. He always appeared to be
rather lazy. And besides that, he didn&#8217;t come
from the range. He came from the river road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, Jack. Maybe he&#8217;s been out all
night for a good time with some of those fellows
from town.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this the two Rovers lost no time in hurrying
to the rifle range, and there practised with
their pistols and their rifles until it was time to
return to the Hall for roll call and the drill before
breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we may not win, but we&#8217;ll make some
kind of a showing,&#8221; remarked Fred.</p>
<p>It was a clear day, the air just bracing enough
to put the cadets of Colby Hall in good spirits.
When the time came for the contest nearly all of
them hurried to the range.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, Lest, show &#8217;em what you can do!&#8221;
cried Paul Halliday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Rovers won&#8217;t have a look-in!&#8221; broke out
Billy Sands. &#8220;It will be a regular walk-away for
Lest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so sure of that,&#8221; answered Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brassy may be all right enough with a pistol;
but don&#8217;t forget that Jack and Fred know
how to handle a rifle,&#8221; added Spouter.</p>
<p>A coin was tossed up and it was thereby decided
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
that the contest with pistols should take
place first. Each contestant was to shoot three
times, the rings on the target counting from 1
to 5. The three contestants were to shoot in
rotation, Fred first, Brassy second, and Jack last.</p>
<p>If Fred was a trifle nervous when he went to
the front to shoot, he did his best to control it.
Taking as careful aim as possible, he fired.</p>
<p>&#8220;A three!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good enough for a starter!&#8221;</p>
<p>With a self-satisfied look on his face, Brassy
Bangs strode forward, took quick aim, and fired.</p>
<p>&#8220;A bull&#8217;s-eye!&#8221; shouted Billy Sands in delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you he could do it!&#8221; added Paul Halliday.</p>
<p>When Jack came to the front he managed to
make a 4.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff!&#8221; cried Randy. &#8220;You&#8217;re only
one point behind!&#8221;</p>
<p>On the second round Fred managed to make a
4, while Jack scored a 3, thus tying the Rovers.
Brassy scored a 4.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven to nine in favor of Bangs!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then came the third round, and again Fred
scored a 3 and Jack did likewise, while Brassy
delighted his cronies by scoring another bull&#8217;s-eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;A total of ten each for the Rovers!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And fourteen for Bangs!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you Lest could hold &#8217;em down!&#8221; shouted
Billy Sands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wait till they shoot with the rifles. He&#8217;ll
walk away from &#8217;em!&#8221; added Paul Halliday.</p>
<p>It must be admitted that the Rovers and their
chums were somewhat disappointed that the score
stood four points in favor of Brassy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Fred, do your best,&#8221; whispered Andy
to his cousin, as the latter went to the front after
carefully examining the rifle handed to him by
Captain Dale.</p>
<p>The firearm was a light affair, but of approved
pattern and supposed to be quite accurate for use
at a distance of two hundred yards.</p>
<p>Fred took longer to aim with the rifle than he
had with the pistol, and there was a breathless silence
until after the report rang out.</p>
<p>&#8220;A four!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff, Fred!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Brassy, let us see what you can do!&#8221;</p>
<p>As confident as ever, Brassy Bangs came to the
front, took the rifle handed to him, and shot
rather hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;A three!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack was up next, and to the dismay of many
of his friends made only a 2.</p>
<p>Then came the second round with rifles, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
in that Fred scored a 4, Bangs a 1, and Jack a 3.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Fred Rover and Brassy Bangs are
tied with eighteen points each.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Jack Rover has fifteen points.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then came the final round, and amid a breathless
silence Fred shot and scored a bull&#8217;s-eye.
Then came Bangs, and made a 2. And Jack ended
the contest with a bull&#8217;s-eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Fred Rover wins the match with
twenty-three points!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and Jack Rover and Brassy Bangs are
tied for second place with twenty each!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah for Fred Rover!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty good shooting, I&#8217;ll say!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all to the merry, Fred!&#8221; exclaimed
Jack, as he caught his cousin&#8217;s hand. &#8220;You did
fine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The best ever!&#8221; burst out Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Jack, why don&#8217;t you and Brassy shoot
off the tie?&#8221; questioned Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing,&#8221; was the ready reply of the young
captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll shoot off the tie with pistols,&#8221; put in Brassy
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, let it be with rifles,&#8221; broke in Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I think would be fair,&#8221; announced
Captain Dale. &#8220;Each of you take one
shot with a rifle and one shot with a pistol.&#8221; And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
after quite a little discussion it was so agreed.</p>
<p>The pistols were used first, and there Brassy
made a bull&#8217;s-eye while Jack managed to register
a 4. Then the rifles were used, and here Jack,
shooting first, made a bull&#8217;s-eye while Brassy
got a 2.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Nine to seven in favor of Captain
Rover!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some shooting, Jack!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had shot as good as that in the first
contest you might have beaten Fred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite content, even if I didn&#8217;t beat Fred,&#8221;
announced the young captain, with a smile.</p>
<p>Brassy Bangs was quite gloomy over the outcome
of the contest, and he and his cronies lost
no time in quitting the range.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad you two fellows beat him,&#8221;
announced Gif. &#8220;Maybe it will take a little of
the conceit out of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Gif, you&#8217;ve got to admit he&#8217;s a wonderful
shot with the pistol,&#8221; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And his rifle work isn&#8217;t any worse than
mine,&#8221; answered Andy. &#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll promise to
make a lot of bull&#8217;s-eyes for you if you&#8217;ll let me
use a good-sized shotgun or a blunderbuss,&#8221; and
at this there was a snicker.</p>
<p>For the rest of that day Brassy Bangs had little
to say. But the next morning he was as loud-mouthed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
as ever, declaring that he would have
won the contest had he been allowed to use his
own pistol&mdash;a long affair of the old-fashioned
western variety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had he done that it might have given him one
more point,&#8221; declared Randy. &#8220;Of course that
would have put him ahead of Jack in the first
contest, but it wouldn&#8217;t have helped him when it
came to the rifle work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s drop Brassy,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;I am really
getting tired of hearing of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t bear him,&#8221; put in Phil Franklin.
&#8220;Once or twice he has tried to become chummy
with me, but I&#8217;ve always given him the cold
shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was now drawing on toward the time for
the election, and there was a great deal of wire-pulling
among the various cadets as to who might
run for the offices. Three names were in the field
for the office of major: Jack, a Captain Glasby,
and a Lieutenant Harkness.</p>
<p>Glasby was a fellow who was very well liked,
while Harkness was a lieutenant who at one time
had been more or less of a crony of Nappy Martell,
Gabe Werner, and others of the crowd that
had been opposed to the Rover boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t complain if Glasby gets the position,&#8221;
declared Jack. &#8220;But I&#8217;d hate mightily to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
see Lieutenant Harkness at the head of the school
battalion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never liked Harkness myself,&#8221; put in
Spouter. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t a bit better in many respects
than Gabe Werner.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was soon noised around the school that
Brassy Bangs and his cronies were doing their
best for Harkness, while another crowd, led by
Bart White, were rooting in rather a lively fashion
for Captain Glasby.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get busy for Jack,&#8221; said Gif to
Spouter. &#8220;Come on! Let&#8217;s sound out all the
fellows in the Hall we think we can influence.&#8221;
And thereupon he and Spouter and a number of
others set to work to electioneer for Jack as hard
as they could.</p>
<p>Several days before the election Andy and
Randy obtained permission to go to Haven Point
on an errand. It was rather a disagreeable,
misty day, and they were tramping along through
the mud on the outskirts of the town when they
saw Brassy Bangs and a stranger ahead of them.
The stranger was a tall, thin individual, dressed
in an old-fashioned suit of rusty black and with
a big slouch hat pulled well down over his head.
He was puffing away at a large black cigar, and
seemed to be very much in earnest in what he
was saying to Brassy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I saw that fellow around the school about a
week ago,&#8221; declared Randy. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t look
like a very nice sort, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly has a fierce-looking mustache,&#8221;
was Andy&#8217;s comment. &#8220;And it&#8217;s as red as his
hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you I can&#8217;t do it, and that&#8217;s all there is
to it,&#8221; the boys heard Brassy exclaim, in reply to
something the stranger had said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I say you&#8217;ve got to do it,&#8221; returned the
man, and his tone was decidedly ugly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got to do it&mdash;or otherwise you&#8217;ve got to take the
consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t be so mean, Haddon!&#8221; pleaded
Brassy, and now the Rovers could see that he
was more or less scared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221; returned the strange man
harshly. &#8220;You just try me and see! The best
thing you can do is to agree to what I said. If
you don&#8217;t, well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and here the tall man
shrugged his shoulders&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;ll do as I said before&mdash;or
you&#8217;ll take the consequences.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>SPOUTER&#8217;S SECRET</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Say, this is rather interesting,&#8221; remarked
Randy in a low tone to his brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow is certainly threatening Brassy,&#8221;
returned Andy. &#8220;I wonder what it can be all
about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants Brassy to do something.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two Rovers kept on behind Bangs and the
man called Haddon, and presently saw them turn
down a side street where was located a small factory
that had been in operation during the war
but which was now closed. Both disappeared
into a shed attached to the factory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see if we can find out what it&#8217;s all about,&#8221;
said Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing,&#8221; answered his twin. &#8220;Maybe that
fellow will grow abusive and hurt Brassy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, a good licking wouldn&#8217;t hurt him,&#8221; answered
his brother, with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right. But we don&#8217;t want to see
him half killed even if we don&#8217;t like him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You trust Brassy to take care of himself,&#8221; was
the quick reply.</p>
<p>The twins hurried to the shed and there found
that the door had been left open and that the man
and their fellow-cadet had gone into another part
of the low building.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know as well as I do that that barn and
them hosses was worth at least twelve thousand
dollars,&#8221; the man was saying to Brassy. &#8220;That
was a big loss for John Calder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t say another word about it!&#8221;
pleaded Brassy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t if you&#8217;ll do as I told you to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve let you have a hundred and ten dollars
already! It&#8217;s every cent I can spare!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got to have more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;ve been gambling it away, Haddon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s none of your business what Bud Haddon
does with his money!&#8221; exclaimed the stranger,
with a toss of his head and blowing a ring of tobacco
smoke toward the ceiling of the shed. &#8220;If
you don&#8217;t want me to start things you do as I told
you to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what I think!&#8221; exclaimed
Brassy, after a pause. &#8220;I think those tramp cowboys
were guilty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t put that off on no cowboys!&#8221; exclaimed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
Bud Haddon. &#8220;I know all about it, and
so do Jillson and Dusenbury.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t know anything&mdash;at least they don&#8217;t
know anything about me!&#8221; cried Brassy. But it
was plainly to be seen that he was exceedingly
nervous. &#8220;Somebody&#8217;s been cooking up a story
against me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t nobody cookin&#8217; up nothin&#8217;,&#8221; growled the
man. &#8220;I know what I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; about. You&#8217;d
better get busy if you know when you&#8217;re well off.
If you don&#8217;t, and your uncle gets wind of this&mdash;well,
good-night for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t say anything to my uncle! Please
don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then you get busy. I&#8217;ve hung around
here about as long as I intend to. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back
to Chicago in a few days.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this juncture the Rovers heard a noise outside,
and several boys playing hide-and-seek appeared.
Not wishing to be discovered by Brassy
and his companion, Andy and Randy hurried out
into the street and up to the corner. Here they
waited for a while, and presently saw Brassy and
Bud Haddon come forth. The man sauntered
away in the direction of the town while Brassy
sped off on the winding road leading to Colby
Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what do you make of this?&#8221; questioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
Randy, as he and his brother continued on their
errand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks rather suspicious to me,&#8221; answered
Andy. &#8220;It looks as if Brassy had done something
that wasn&#8217;t right and this man was going to expose
him unless Brassy paid over some hush
money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and from what Brassy said, he evidently
has already paid the man one hundred and ten
dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the way back to Colby Hall after their errand
was finished the twins discussed the matter,
but could arrive at no satisfactory conclusion.
That evening they told their cousins of what they
had heard, and also mentioned the matter to Gif
and Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks to me as if that Bud Haddon had a
hold on Brassy,&#8221; remarked Jack. &#8220;But whether
Brassy is really guilty or not of some wrongdoing
remains to be found out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t put it past him to do something that
wasn&#8217;t right,&#8221; came from Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;That remains to be seen, Fred. Brassy might
do some things that we wouldn&#8217;t do; but at the
same time I doubt if he&#8217;s so very bad at heart.
He&#8217;s loud-mouthed and has a hasty temper, and
he likes to show off, and all that sort of thing,
but that doesn&#8217;t say he&#8217;s a criminal.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That Bud Haddon looks like a bad one,&#8221; announced
Randy. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t trust him with a
nickel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is a mystery,&#8221; came from Fred.
&#8220;Just the same as it&#8217;s a mystery about Professor
Duke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, don&#8217;t mention Duke!&#8221; broke out Gif.
&#8220;I had all I could do to keep from getting into a
row with him this morning. He certainly is a
tart one at times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he looks troubled,&#8221; answered Jack.
&#8220;Ever since Colonel Colby spoke about him I&#8217;ve
been watching him carefully. And, believe me,
that man has something on his mind that&#8217;s far
from pleasant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly comes and goes a good deal,&#8221;
said Spouter. &#8220;He was away several hours last
night and the night before. And I understand
he&#8217;s going away to-morrow afternoon again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Colby must know it&#8217;s all right.
Otherwise he wouldn&#8217;t let him go away so much,&#8221;
declared Gif.</p>
<p>On the following morning when the mail was
distributed Spouter received a letter from his
father that interested him greatly. He read the
communication several times, and then, placing it
in his pocket, ran off to where he had left Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Gif!&#8221; he cried gayly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
great news! Come ahead and help find the Rovers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the news?&#8221; demanded the other, as
they hurried on side by side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wait and I&#8217;ll tell you all about it&mdash;maybe.&#8221;
And then Spouter stopped short, struck
by a sudden idea. He thought for a few seconds
and then his face broke into a broad smile.</p>
<p>The two boys found the Rovers up in Room
20, which the four cousins used as a sitting room.
All were busy studying and looked up in surprise
as Spouter dashed in with Gif at his heels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glorious news, boys! Glorious news!&#8221; sang
out Spouter, as he beamed at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; they demanded in chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glorious, I tell you, glorious!&#8221; Spouter waved
his hands eloquently. &#8220;Why remain cooped up
here within the dingy walls of a school when the
mighty plains, the boundless forests, the leaping
streams, and the azure blue of the skies await
you? Why snuff the tainted air of the musty
classroom when the free ozone of the hills and
mountains beckons to you? Why waste time over
musty books when rifle and fishing rod can be
had, when one can fling himself in the saddle and
go dashing madly across the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jumping crabs and hopping mud turtles!&#8221; exclaimed
Andy. &#8220;Spouter has got &#8217;em again!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is this, Spouter?&#8221; demanded Randy. &#8220;A
moving picture, or just a plain everyday nightmare?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, ha!&#8221; continued Spouter, prancing around.
&#8220;Whoopee! Bang! Bang! Let her go, boys!
Lasso him quick before he gets away!&#8221; and the
talkative cadet made a movement as if throwing
a lasso.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Spouter, come down to earth, will you?&#8221;
cried Jack, grabbing his chum by the shoulder.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he swallowed a few yeast cakes by
mistake,&#8221; remarked Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the best news ever, fellows!&#8221; went on
Spouter. &#8220;I got it this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right! Let&#8217;s have it,&#8221; came quickly from
Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting for this news for several
weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;News from where?&#8221; came from the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;News from home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From your dad?&#8221; questioned Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has he done now&mdash;bought you an automobile?&#8221;
questioned Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better than that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake, spill out what you&#8217;ve got
to say!&#8221; returned Fred, in exasperation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When we went to Cedar Lodge on our grand
hunt we were Gif&#8217;s guests,&#8221; resumed Spouter.
&#8220;This summer the tables are to be turned, and all
of you are to be the guests of yours truly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, that sounds interesting, Spouter!&#8221; cried
Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do we go and when?&#8221; questioned his
twin.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re to go just as soon as school shuts down
and you can get ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where to?&#8221; questioned Jack curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! that&#8217;s the deep, dark and delightful secret,&#8221;
returned Spouter. &#8220;You&#8217;re all to be my
guests, and I&#8217;ll promise you the time of your lives.
Oh, boys, but this is going to be something great!&#8221;
And the cadet playfully pounded one and another
on the shoulder with his fist.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can we go if we don&#8217;t know where
we&#8217;re going?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll know, Fred, before you&#8217;re on the way,&#8221;
was the mysterious answer. &#8220;And, believe me,
after you&#8217;ve found out you won&#8217;t want to turn
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! do you mean you&#8217;re not going to tell
us where we&#8217;re going?&#8221; demanded Jack, in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly, Jack. That&#8217;s going to be my little
secret until this school shuts up,&#8221; and Spouter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
folded his arms calmly and grinned at all his
chums.</p>
<p>They looked at him in blank amazement. This
was a proceeding that had never happened before.
Suddenly Gif made a dash forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s pound it out of him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk! We&#8217;ll make him tell!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull him down and sit on him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull off his shoes and tickle his feet! He&#8217;s
got to tell!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poke him in the ribs!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He got a letter this morning. I&#8217;ll bet the
news is in that!&#8221; shouted Gif. &#8220;It&#8217;s in his pocket
now!&#8221;</p>
<p>All attempted to pounce upon Spouter, but he
was too quick for them, and, dashing across the
room, he shot into Fred&#8217;s bedroom, banging the
door after him. Then, as the others followed,
he ran out into the corridor and then sped for his
own room, where he locked the door behind him.
Then he hid the letter in a place where he was
sure none of his chums would find it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this takes the bakery!&#8221; announced
Randy, after all of them had pounded on Spouter&#8217;s
door in vain. &#8220;What do you suppose it
means?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s simple enough,&#8221; remarked Jack. &#8220;Spouter
is going to invite us on some sort of outing this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
summer, but he doesn&#8217;t want to tell us yet what
sort it&#8217;s to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He spoke about mountains and rivers and
horseback riding,&#8221; said Randy. &#8220;That looks like
some sort of outdoor affair,&#8221; and his eyes glistened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on out, Spouter, and let us love you a
little,&#8221; called Fred through the keyhole.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go on down and I&#8217;ll meet you downstairs,&#8221;
was the reply. &#8220;And remember, you&#8217;re
not to know another word about this until vacation
comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to take us away in a submarine,
Spouter?&#8221; demanded Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;s going to take us in an airship to the
south pole,&#8221; declared his twin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind where I&#8217;m going to take you,&#8221;
answered Spouter. &#8220;You just keep calm until
vacation time comes, and then you&#8217;ll learn fast
enough in what direction you&#8217;re going to travel.
And, believe me, we&#8217;ll have some outing, or else
I&#8217;ll miss my guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>And with this statement the Rover boys and
Gif had to be content.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE ELECTION FOR OFFICERS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Company attention! Shoulder arms! Forward
march!&#8221;</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom, boom, boom!</p>
<p>The drums rang out clearly on the morning air
and the Colby Hall battalion swung into line on a
march that carried it around the school buildings
and then to the lake shore. Here Colonel Colby
and Captain Dale inspected the three companies.
Then the retiring major, Ralph Mason, was called
on for a little speech which brought forth many
cheers, and after this the command was dismissed.</p>
<p>It was the day for the election, and there was
to be no school session until the afternoon.</p>
<p>At the last election there had been a total of
111 votes cast. But now there were one hundred
and twenty-five cadets at the institution. There
had been some talk of organizing a new command
to be known as Company D, but so far this had
not materialized.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>As was the custom, the election was held in
the main hall of the school and was presided over
by Captain Dale and Professor Brice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see they expect a hundred and twenty-five
votes,&#8221; remarked Randy. &#8220;That means sixty-three
will be necessary to a choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sure Jack will get at least forty on
the first vote,&#8221; returned his brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope he gets the whole sixty-three,&#8221; put in
Dan Soppinger. Dan had once run for a captaincy,
but had dropped out and turned most of
his attention to athletics.</p>
<p>As at other elections, it was decided by Colonel
Colby that each officer should be voted for separately.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try for a new major first,&#8221; announced
the head of the Hall.</p>
<p>The ballot box was placed on the table, and
after a short intermission during which there was
some very active electioneering among the various
groups assembled, a bell rang and the cadets
were formed in one long line and told to march
up and deposit their ballots in the box.</p>
<p>It must be admitted that Jack was rather
anxious, although he did his best to conceal it. He
smiled at Captain Glasby, who smiled back. Then
he smiled at Lieutenant Harkness, but that under-officer
only favored him with a scowl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Harkness will never win anything with that
look on his face,&#8221; was Gif&#8217;s comment, as he noticed
the scowl. &#8220;The fellows like an officer who
can take things pleasantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>It did not take the cadets long to vote, and as
soon as all of the ballots had been cast Captain
Dale, assisted by Professor Brice, began to tabulate
the vote. In less than ten minutes they had
finished. Then a bell rang and Captain Dale came
forward to read the result.</p>
<table summary='votes'>
<tr><td align='left'>&#8220;Total number of votes cast&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align='right'>125&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Necessary to a choice</td><td align='right'>63&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Louis Glasby has</td><td align='right'>51&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Jack Rover has</td><td align='right'>50&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Darrell Harkness has</td><td align='right'>24&#8221;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about that!&#8221; exclaimed
Fred. &#8220;Jack and Glasby are within one vote of
each other!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say that&#8217;s getting pretty close,&#8221; answered
Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;As no cadet has received the number of votes
necessary to a choice, I will give the school a
recess for fifteen minutes. Then we will vote
again&mdash;for the same cadets or for new ones if
you feel so inclined.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this brief announcement by Captain Dale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
came a hum of voices and there was some strenuous
electioneering in all parts of the hall and also
in the corridors and out on the campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glasby is stronger than I thought he was,&#8221;
remarked Gif to Jack. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to do some
tall work to overcome his vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we can get some of the Harkness fellows
to come over to us,&#8221; put in Spouter. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s as popular as he thinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we can get him to withdraw,&#8221; suggested
Andy, with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Withdraw, not!&#8221; broke out Fred. &#8220;He&#8217;s not
that sort.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the conversation was going on somebody
touched Jack on the shoulder, and turning
he found himself confronted by Paul Halliday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, see here, Rover! I&#8217;d like a word with
you,&#8221; whispered Halliday somewhat excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, shoot!&#8221; answered the young captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a little private matter,&#8221; went on Halliday.
&#8220;You can bring your cousins along if you
want to,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Wondering what Halliday had in his mind,
Jack, along with Fred and Andy who happened
to be close by, followed him to an out-of-the-way
corner of a corridor.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to know if you&#8217;re willing to make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
a deal with us,&#8221; said Halliday in a low, nervous
tone of voice. &#8220;You know Harkness got twenty-four
votes. Well, he&#8217;s willing to throw those
votes to you if you are willing to back him for
the new captain of Company C.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; answered Jack quickly. &#8220;If
I get to be major I&#8217;m going to back Fred here
for the captaincy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but, Jack, I could drop out of that!&#8221; put
in his cousin quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much, Fred! I said I was going to do
it, and I&#8217;m going to stick to my word. Besides
that, I might as well tell you, Halliday, that I
don&#8217;t believe Harkness is the best fellow for the
position.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you won&#8217;t consider my offer?&#8221; demanded
Halliday sourly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you can control the Harkness
votes,&#8221; put in Andy. &#8220;I believe Jack will get a
whole lot of them on the next ballot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t get a one of them, and he&#8217;ll lose
some of his own!&#8221; answered Paul Halliday.
&#8220;You just wait and see!&#8221; And then he walked
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, that move might have given you the
majorship,&#8221; said Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;ve got to get it that way, Fred, I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
want it,&#8221; was the prompt reply. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
vote for Harkness under any circumstances. He&#8217;s
in hand and glove with Brassy Bangs, Halliday,
Sands, and that whole bunch; and I don&#8217;t believe
he ought to be an officer.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few minutes later came a commotion near
the main entrance of the Hall. A cadet named
Gibson who was doing some electioneering for
Glasby had knocked Paul Halliday down, and
there was every prospect of a fight when the two
cadets were separated by a number of friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;He offered to sell the Harkness vote if our
crowd would vote later on the way he wanted us
to!&#8221; declared Gibson. &#8220;You would think he had
half the vote of the Hall in his pocket,&#8221; and he
glared at Halliday, who thereupon lost no time in
sneaking out of sight.</p>
<p>The report that Halliday, Sands, and even
Brassy Bangs were trying to sell the Harkness
vote in exchange for some votes for a captaincy
soon spread, and a number of the cadets who had
voted for the lieutenant became disgusted and
promptly said they were going to change. A
lively discussion followed, in the midst of which
the bell rang for the second ballot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, Jack! if some of those fellows do change
their votes I hope they come to you,&#8221; murmured
Gif.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must confess I&#8217;m hoping that myself,&#8221;
answered the young captain, with a smile.</p>
<p>Once more the boys lined up and deposited their
ballots. Then came some anxious waiting, and
finally Captain Dale announced the result:</p>
<p>&#8220;Total number of votes cast.....125
Necessary to a choice............63
Jack Rover has...................67
Louis Glasby has.................46
Darrell Harkness has..............9
Peter Floyd has...................3&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Jack wins!&#8221; cried Fred enthusiastically,
and was the first person to grab his cousin
by the hand and shake it warmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s great, Jack!&#8221; exclaimed Gif, slapping
him on the shoulder. &#8220;Let me congratulate you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just the result I was looking for!&#8221; burst
in Spouter, his face wreathed in smiles.</p>
<p>Of course, Louis Glasby was much disappointed,
but he took his defeat in good part and
came up bravely to shake Jack by the hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a fair and square contest, Jack,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;And I congratulate you.&#8221; And then
turning to the other cadets he called out: &#8220;Three
cheers for Major Rover!&#8221; They were given with
a will; and then Colonel Colby, Captain Dale,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
and many of the older persons came forward to
congratulate the newly-elected head of the school
battalion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speech! Speech!&#8221; came the cry from the
students. &#8220;A speech from the new major!&#8221; and
almost before he was aware of it Jack was escorted
to the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to say to you,&#8221; he said, as
he faced his fellow-students. &#8220;I thank you very
heartily for your support and I will do my best
to deserve it. I want to say that I am particularly
pleased at the nice manner in which Louis
Glasby has taken his defeat. He&#8217;s a fine fellow
and I hope I shall always have him for my
friend.&#8221; And following these words there was
more cheering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evidently the Harkness combination went to
pieces,&#8221; remarked Randy. &#8220;He polled only nine
votes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that was nine too many,&#8221; murmured his
brother.</p>
<p>Following the election for major, Captain Dale
announced that they would next vote for a new
captain for Company A.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you fellows are going to
do, but I know I&#8217;m going to vote for Louis
Glasby,&#8221; announced Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a whole lot of fellows will do that,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
answered Fred. &#8220;He&#8217;ll probably get every one
of his original fifty-one votes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again there was an intermission of a quarter
of an hour, and then the boys were lined up for
the vote to fill the vacancy in Company A. On
the first ballot Glasby got 60 votes while Fred
poled 18 votes, the rest being scattering. Then
on the second ballot Glasby was declared elected
with 69 votes in his favor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three cheers for Captain Glasby of Company
A!&#8221; called out Jack quickly, as he shook hands
with his late rival, and the cheers were given with
as much of a will as they had been for the newly-elected
major.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I got thirty-two votes on that last ballot,&#8221;
announced Fred. &#8220;That shows I&#8217;ve got some
friends in this school. I don&#8217;t want to be the
captain of Company A. I&#8217;d rather remain a lieutenant
of Company C.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ve got to have a new captain for Company
C now that Jack has stepped out,&#8221; put in
Phil Franklin.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later the balloting began
for a new captain for the company Jack had
commanded. Here developed a spirited rivalry,
and it was not until the fifth ballot that the final
vote was taken. Then Fred won by 64 votes with
the other votes scattered among eight contestants.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Three cheers for Captain Fred Rover!&#8221;
shouted Phil Franklin enthusiastically, and threw
his cap high in the air. He had electioneered as
hard as anybody for the youngest Rover.</p>
<p>Then Fred was called on for a little speech, and
after that there was another election for lieutenants
and a number of minor officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly was our day, Fred,&#8221; said Jack, as
he and his cousin shook hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, Major Rover,&#8221; and Fred saluted
in the most precise military fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bonfires to-night, boys!&#8221; sang out Andy.
&#8220;And we&#8217;ll have some big doings, believe me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are!&#8221; declared his twin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>BONFIRE NIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>It was the custom at Colby Hall for the officers
of the battalion to take dinner with Colonel
Colby on the day of an election. This was quite
a formal affair and the cadets to participate made
it a point to look their best.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Jack, you&#8217;re going to make a stunning
looking major,&#8221; remarked Fred, as he watched his
cousin dressing.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about yourself as captain?&#8221; was the
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wait till Ruth Stevenson sees Jack in his
new uniform!&#8221; cried Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Jack, why not have a life-sized photo
taken and give it to her to hang over her dressing
table?&#8221; put in Andy, with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;You beware, Andy,&#8221; admonished his cousin,
waving a finger severely at him. &#8220;Remember, as
the commandant of the battalion, I can throw you
into a dungeon cell if I feel so inclined,&#8221; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
Jack strutted around grandly in the privacy of the
Rovers&#8217; sitting room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be good, oh, Most Noble One,&#8221; answered
the fun-loving Rover, bowing down until his head
almost touched his feet.</p>
<p>Jack and Fred had already sent word to Martha
and Mary, and they, of course, had told Ruth
and the others. It is needless to say that the
Rover girls and their chums were almost as much
pleased over the results of the election as the boys
had been.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just dying to see them on parade with
Jack at the head,&#8221; confided Martha to the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and Fred in command of Company C,&#8221;
added Mary. &#8220;Just to think of it! And he so
much younger than the others!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I&#8217;m on hand to see their first parade,&#8221;
said Ruth, her eyes beaming with pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were going to write Jack a letter
about that party,&#8221; said Martha in a low tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am. To-night. And I&#8217;ll let him know that
I&#8217;ve wanted to do it ever since the party was
talked of,&#8221; went on Ruth.</p>
<p>The officers&#8217; dinner was a great success. Every
one present made a little speech and Colonel Colby
and Captain Dale made addresses to which the
cadets listened with keen attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my desire to make this military academy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
one of the best in the country,&#8221; declared the
colonel earnestly. &#8220;And I cannot do that without
the sincere coöperation of every cadet attending
the institution. As many of you know&#8221;&mdash;and
here he glanced at Jack and Fred&mdash;&#8220;when I was
about your age I attended Putnam Hall Military
Academy. I am sure the training I received there
did me much good, and I am also sure that I
made many friends who will stand by me as long
as I live.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want this institution to be one of good-fellowship
all around, and I am relying upon all of
you to do your best. At Putnam Hall in many
respects we followed the honor system which I
have put into operation here. That honor system
did not fail there, and I do not look for it to fail
here. I want you all to have a good time; but
there is a limit, and every one of you knows what
that limit is just as well as I do. In the late war
the training which some of our soldiers had received
at Putnam Hall stood them in good stead.
And I want the training received here to be of
equal benefit if any of my cadets should ever be
called upon to fight for our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three cheers for Colonel Colby!&#8221; came from
Jack a minute later, and the boys assembled
nearly split their throats trying to do justice to
their feelings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>While this dinner was going on the other cadets
had their repast in the mess hall and then
flew off in all directions to prepare for the real
festivities of the evening. They had gotten together
several piles of barrels and boxes, as well
as brushwood from the forest behind the school,
and these were soon heaped up along the river
bank into great bonfires, the light of which could
be seen a long distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be some night, believe me!&#8221; sang
out Andy merrily. &#8220;We&#8217;ll tear the woodpile
down, as the old saying is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be a little bit careful or else we&#8217;ll
have Snopper Duke or some other professor calling
us down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Snopper Duke is going away. I heard him
tell one of the other teachers that he had had a
sudden call to go somewhere out of town,&#8221; answered
Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going away again, eh?&#8221; questioned Gif, in
surprise. &#8220;He certainly is getting to be a regular
Man of Mystery.&#8221;</p>
<p>The greater part of the cadets were wildly excited
over the prospects of a good time that night.
A few of them, however, including Lieutenant
Harkness, Paul Halliday, and Brassy Bangs,
looked far from pleased.</p>
<p>&#8220;They make me tired,&#8221; was Brassy&#8217;s comment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
&#8220;You&#8217;d think that being major of the school battalion
was next to being president.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can&#8217;t be anything better than a lieutenant
I think I&#8217;ll resign altogether,&#8221; returned Harkness.
&#8220;I&#8217;d rather go in for athletics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have a pretty good chance if you do,&#8221;
announced Paul Halliday. &#8220;I understand they&#8217;re
going to try to divorce the officers from participating
in baseball and football as much as possible.
A fellow can hold a commission and be on
a team at the same time only when it seems absolutely
necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Jack Rover and Fred Rover will have
to give up playing baseball,&#8221; put in Brassy quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than likely. Although, of course, they&#8217;ll
hate to lose such good players as they are,&#8221; put
in another cadet who was present.</p>
<p>When the officers&#8217; dinner was at an end Jack
and Fred lost no time in hurrying to their rooms,
where they donned their old uniforms. It was
what was termed a &#8220;holiday night&#8221; at the Hall,
which meant that for the time being the cadets
were all on an even footing and must treat each
other as if such a thing as an officer was unknown.</p>
<p>By the time Jack and Fred joined the crowd
along the river bank the fun was at its height.
Many of the cadets were running around indulging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
in all sorts of horseplay while others were
dancing around the bonfires singing the songs
they had learned in the school and while at the
encampments. Several of the boys, including
Andy, were in clowns&#8217; costume with big slapsticks
which they used vigorously on everybody
who came within their reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah, boys, let her flicker!&#8221; cried Fred, as
he rushed forward. &#8220;Everybody join in!&#8221; he
added, and then boomed out with this well-known
Hall refrain:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style=' margin-left:4em;'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Who are we?</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Can&#8217;t you see?</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Colby Hall!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Dum! Dum! Dum, dum, dum!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Here we come with fife and drum!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Colby! Colby! Colby Hall!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff!&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have it
again!&#8221; And then the refrain boomed out louder
than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on! Let&#8217;s march around the school,&#8221;
came from Gif, and he caught up a firebrand as
he spoke.</p>
<p>A number of others were quick to follow his
example, and in a minute more a torchlight procession
was in progress, winding along over the
campus, around the school, and through the edge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
of the woods beyond. Then the boys came back
by way of the barns and sheds in the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out that you don&#8217;t set something on
fire,&#8221; warned Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something is on fire already!&#8221; burst out
Andy suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say!&#8221; queried Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the fire?&#8221; demanded half a dozen
others, looking around anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right down there,&#8221; declared the fun-loving
Rover, and pointed to the bonfires along the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow! Let&#8217;s duck him for that!&#8221; cried Phil
Franklin.</p>
<p>He made a dive for Andy and so did several
others, but the agile Rover was too quick for
them and danced out of their reach, having no
desire to take an involuntary bath in the river,
which at that time of the year was very cold.</p>
<p>In the past the cadets had had considerable
fun with Job Plunger, the school janitor, who was
quite deaf and who was often called Shout because
everybody had to shout at him to make him
hear. But this time Plunger was wise and kept
out of sight, as did also Pud Hicks, his assistant,
and Bob Nixon, the chauffeur. The only person
the boys could get hold of was Si Crews, the gymnastic
instructor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give us a song, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked several of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
the boys at once, for Si Crews was known to be
quite a singer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will if Lowe will play the mandolin or the
banjo,&#8221; answered Crews.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff, Ned!&#8221; called Fred. &#8220;Go on
and get your mandolin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned Lowe, who was also a good singer, was
willing, and at once ran off into the school to get
the musical instrument mentioned. When he
came out he tuned up hastily and then played
while Si Crews sang one or two old-time songs.
Then Ned gave the crowd one or two funny songs
and a dozen or more of the cadets joined in the
chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a chance to get square with Codfish!&#8221;
cried Fred, as the sneak of the school showed himself
in the crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we might as well let Codfish drop,&#8221; answered
Jack.</p>
<p>But before this could be done Andy and Randy
caught hold of Stowell and pushed him forward
through the circle of merry cadets around one of
the fires.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to initiate you in the Ancient
Order of Cornmeal,&#8221; declared Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be initiated,&#8221; answered Codfish.
&#8220;You let me alone!&#8221;</p>

THERE DESCENDED UPON CODFISH SEVERAL POUNDS OF FINELY-GROUND CORNMEAL.<br />

</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but this is a first-class Order, Codfish,&#8221;
returned Randy. &#8220;If your reputation is bad it
will render you almost spotless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You let me go!&#8221; burst out Codfish in sudden
fear, as Andy and Randy and several others came
close to him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any horseplay to-night.
I&#8217;m tired out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be initiated in this Order you&#8217;ve got to
lie down,&#8221; continued Andy, and, motioning to
his brother and some of the others, they suddenly
caught poor Codfish and stretched him out
on the grass in front of the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ready to be initiated?&#8221; questioned
Randy solemnly, as he stood over Codfish with a
small paper bag in one hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You let me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Codfish.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says &#8216;let me!&#8217;&#8221; burst out Randy quickly.
&#8220;So go to it, Most Potent Sower of the Ancient
and Honorable Order of Cornmeal! Go to it, I
say!&#8221;</p>
<p>And thereupon without further ado Randy
overturned the paper bag he held in his hand and
there descended upon Codfish several pounds of
finely-ground meal which the lads had purchased
in town a day or two before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi! Hi! What&#8217;s this? You let me go!&#8221;
cried Codfish, and then began to splutter as the
dry cornmeal got into his mouth and nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, Codfish, you&#8217;d make a regular muffin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
now,&#8221; declared Andy, as the whitened youth
struggled to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give us a song, Codfish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make it a regular corncake hoedown,&#8221; put in
Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You let me go!&#8221; shrieked Codfish, and then
in commingled rage and fear he suddenly caught
up a long firebrand from the bonfire and whirled
it around rapidly before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of my way&mdash;all of you!&#8221; he screamed,
and the next minute made a movement as if to
dash the firebrand directly into Randy&#8217;s face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A STARTLING DISCOVERY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Drop that, Codfish!&#8221; exclaimed Randy, and
backed away so suddenly that he tripped over some
brushwood and came down flat on his back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be tormented any more,&#8221;
stormed Codfish, and swung the firebrand around
again, this time so the flames brushed Andy&#8217;s
shoulder and also Fred&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop that, you imp!&#8221; exclaimed Ned Lowe.
&#8220;Do you want to put out somebody&#8217;s eyes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care! You&#8217;ve got to let me alone!&#8221;
screamed Codfish.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t let you alone until you learn how
to behave yourself and act like the other fellows
do,&#8221; answered Andy. &#8220;You&#8217;re the worst sneak
this school ever had, and you know it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and see how you acted after all we did
for you when we were at Cedar Lodge,&#8221; added
Randy, who had scrambled to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t mean to say anything about those
snowballs,&#8221; whined Stowell. &#8220;They made me do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
it!&#8221; And thereupon, pitching the firebrand back
on the bonfire, he pushed his way through the
crowd of cadets and disappeared in the darkness
in the direction of the school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, he certainly is a pill!&#8221; was Dan Soppinger&#8217;s
comment. &#8220;I think none of us would
weep if Codfish left the school for good. How
about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind&mdash;don&#8217;t let it spoil the festivities,&#8221;
cried Andy gayly. &#8220;Come on! Everybody join
in! A fine of one suspender button for the fellows
who don&#8217;t sing!&#8221; And thereupon he began
a ditty he had composed during the war.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style=' margin-left:4em;'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Johnny get your musket!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>You must get your musket!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Johnny get your musket!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>You must get it now!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>And this ditty the lads sang over and over
again as they leaped and swung in a circle around
the bonfires.</p>
<p>But all gala occasions must come to an end, and
by eleven o&#8217;clock the bonfires were nothing but
heaps of smouldering ashes, and then one by one
the cadets returned to the Hall and retired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jack, it will seem kind of funny, won&#8217;t
it, to be at the head of the school battalion to-morrow
morning?&#8221; questioned Gif, as he and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
newly-elected major turned into the corridor leading
to their rooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Gif. But it won&#8217;t be so very strange
either, because you know I had to command the
battalion two or three times when the other officers
were away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their activities during the whole of the day
had made the cadets sleepy, and nearly all turned
in without much ado. Here and there there was
an exception, and these included Fatty Hendry
and Dan Soppinger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get out some sort of a composition
on City Improvements,&#8221; declared Fatty. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know much about &#8217;em, but if I don&#8217;t get the
paper in by nine o&#8217;clock to-morrow morning
there&#8217;s going to be trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I still have some examples in algebra to
work out,&#8221; answered Dan. &#8220;So I think I&#8217;ll go at
them before I retire.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of the Rovers slept soundly and did not
awaken until they heard an unexpected knock on
their door some time before the rising bell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me in,&#8221; came in the voice of Dan Soppinger.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got news.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack opened the door and Dan came in, followed
by Fatty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what do you know about this!&#8221; exclaimed
Dan. &#8220;Colby Hall has been robbed!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Robbed!&#8221; ejaculated Jack. &#8220;What do you
mean? What did they take?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did they take!&#8221; burst out Fatty. &#8220;I
guess they took about everything they could get
their hands on that was easy to carry off. I lost
my stickpin and my watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I lost two old stickpins and two rings
that I haven&#8217;t been wearing,&#8221; put in Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you find this out?&#8221; questioned the
newly-elected major.</p>
<p>&#8220;I made the discovery just when I was going
to bed after doing some examples in algebra,&#8221; answered
Dan. &#8220;It was about half-past twelve, so
I didn&#8217;t want to wake anybody up&mdash;that is, none
of the other fellows, although I did call on Fatty
because I knew he was writing a composition.
He looked around his room then and found he
had been robbed, too. Then, as Professor Duke
was away, we called on Professor Watson. He
made an investigation and then said he would report
to Colonel Colby the first thing this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The talk in Jack&#8217;s room had brought Fred to
the scene, and a few minutes later Randy and
Andy came in, rubbing their eyes sleepily.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was your stuff worth, Dan?&#8221; questioned
Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the rings were worth about fifteen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
dollars each, and the stickpins almost as much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My stickpin was worth thirty-five dollars,&#8221;
groaned Fatty. &#8220;And the watch was a gold one
given to me by my grandfather, and I wouldn&#8217;t
lose that for a good deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hark! What&#8217;s that commotion?&#8221; put in Jack
suddenly.</p>
<p>There was a murmur of excited voices in the
corridor, and, throwing open the door, the Rovers
and their friends came out to see what was up.</p>
<p>&#8220;My room has been robbed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My watch is gone and a whole lot of other
jewelry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I lost three dollars!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh, that isn&#8217;t anything! I lost fourteen
dollars and a half!&#8221;</p>
<p>So the talk ran on as an excited group of
cadets, some fully attired and some still wearing
their pajamas, crowded forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what do you know about this!&#8221; exclaimed
Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is anything belonging to us gone?&#8221; questioned
Jack suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to find out,&#8221; came from
Randy. &#8220;I was so sleepy last night that I just
tumbled into bed and let it go at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without further ado the four Rovers ran back
into the rooms they occupied and began a search
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
of their chiffoniers and the other places where
they kept their things of value.</p>
<p>&#8220;My stickpin is gone and also one of my rings,&#8221;
groaned Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a brand new five-dollar bill tucked away
in one of my drawers,&#8221; said his brother. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t find it anywhere. And, yes, my wrist-watch
is missing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My watch and chain and stickpin are gone,
and likewise all my badges!&#8221; cried Fred. &#8220;Oh,
this is the worst ever!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m out a ring and three stickpins,&#8221; announced
Jack, &#8220;including that brand new pin I
got last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>As quickly as possible the four Rovers dressed
and then joined the other cadets in the corridor.
From all sides were heard excited exclamations
as one pupil after another came forward to announce
that either his jewelry or his money&mdash;and
sometimes both&mdash;were gone.</p>
<p>Colonel Colby and several of the professors had
already been notified, and they quickly appeared
on the scene and tried to interview the cadets.
This, however, was a hard thing to undertake because
nearly all the boys wanted to talk at once.
There was so much excitement that for the time
being the morning parade and breakfast were
completely forgotten.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is certainly a terrible state of affairs,&#8221;
remarked the colonel to Captain Dale. &#8220;Have
you any idea who can be guilty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Colonel. I have always thought that
every one connected with this school was honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be the work of some of the hired help,&#8221;
mused Colonel Colby. &#8220;But I hate to think that.
Every one who is here came highly recommended.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We might make inquiry and see if any
strangers were in the school last night during the
celebration,&#8221; suggested Captain Dale. &#8220;There
was so much excitement that some one might have
slipped in and out without our noticing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally Colonel Colby told all the cadets to go
below for breakfast, dispensing with the early
morning drill.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as you have finished eating I wish
each cadet to make a thorough search of his room
and make out a written list of everything that is
missing and sign the paper. Take careful note
of everything when you are making your search,
and if you find any clues to the perpetrator of
this outrageous affair, let me know. The lists can
be left at the office as soon as they are made out.&#8221;
And then, after a moment of thought, he added:
&#8220;There will be no session of the school this morning.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we notify the Haven Point authorities?&#8221;
questioned Professor Brice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at present. I wish to make my own investigation
first,&#8221; answered the head of the school.</p>
<p>It did not take Jack and his cousins long to
swallow their breakfast, and this finished, they
hurried back to their rooms and began the search
Colonel Colby had advised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m shy that gold fountain pen Aunt
Martha gave me,&#8221; announced Jack presently. &#8220;I&#8217;d
forgotten about that because I didn&#8217;t usually use
it. I use the one mother gave me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside of this the Rovers could find nothing
more missing nor did they locate anything in the
way of a clue that might lead to the robber. They
sat down and made out their brief lists, signed
them, and then walked together down to the
office.</p>
<p>Here a crowd of cadets were coming and going.
It was learned that twenty-two cadets in all had
suffered losses which ranged from seventy-five
cents to one hundred and twenty-five dollars. In
all it was figured that the loss would amount to
at least twelve hundred dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is about the worst thing that ever struck
Colby Hall,&#8221; announced Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who do you suppose did it?&#8221; questioned
Randy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me, Randy. I&#8217;d hate to suspect any
of the fellows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think any of the fellows did it!&#8221;
burst out Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about the hired help?&#8221; questioned
Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know any of them that I&#8217;d suspect,&#8221;
said Jack promptly. &#8220;Every one looks like a
pretty good sort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only two cadets came forward with objects
that might possibly be a clue to the robbery. One
boy had picked up a handkerchief in his room
that he said did not belong to him, and another
boy had found the marks of muddy footprints
over his window sill and on a fire-escape outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that looks as if somebody had come up
the fire-escape and got into the rooms that way,&#8221;
said Jack, when he heard of this.</p>
<p>&#8220;They say the handkerchief that was picked up
is not marked in any way,&#8221; said Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, every handkerchief used by the cadets
is marked,&#8221; returned Spouter. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got to
be that way or they&#8217;d get all mixed up in the
laundry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Their stuff is all marked, too. One of the
teachers told me so,&#8221; put in Dan Soppinger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Ned! you came upstairs for your mandolin,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
cried Jack suddenly. &#8220;Did you see anybody
up here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember that I did,&#8221; answered Ned
Lowe. &#8220;I was in such a hurry to get the instrument
that I didn&#8217;t pay much attention. And, besides
that, it seemed pretty dark in here after
coming away from that big bonfire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A robber would be sure to keep out of Ned&#8217;s
sight,&#8221; put in Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember seeing some fellows in the lower
hall&mdash;Major Mason, Bart White, and one or two
others. But I can&#8217;t seem to remember seeing anybody
upstairs&mdash;and yet, somehow or other, it
seems to me I did pass somebody just before I ran
into my room,&#8221; and now Ned looked perplexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you think who it was?&#8221; questioned Andy
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it was a stranger you would have remembered,
wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I would, Jack. I&#8217;d think right away
what that person was doing upstairs.&#8221; Ned
scratched his head. &#8220;No, if I did meet somebody,
I&#8217;m sure it must have been one of the cadets.
But who it was, I can&#8217;t think.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little later Colonel Colby continued his investigation
by asking all those who had been inside
the building during the celebration to come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
forward and tell anything they could that might
be of advantage. It developed that not only Ned
but also Ralph Mason, Bart White and two of
the older cadets named Lawrence and Philips had
been upstairs some time between eight and eleven
o&#8217;clock. The most of these cadets said they had
seen no one else upstairs in the building. But
Bart White declared while at one end of a long
corridor he had seen some one slip around a
corner out of sight. He was not sure whether
the person had been a cadet, one of the hired
help, or an outsider.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was either a man or a big boy,&#8221; said Bart.
&#8220;But he moved so quickly and it was so dark I
didn&#8217;t recognize him, even if I happened to know
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what time was this?&#8221; questioned Colonel
Colby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some time between half-past nine and ten
o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bart was asked to show the colonel where the
disappearance of the stranger had taken place,
and it was proved that this was at a point just
around a corner from the room where the footprints
leading to the fire-escape had been discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you saw the person just at the time
he was making his escape,&#8221; was Colonel Colby&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
comment. &#8220;We will look for footprints below
the fire-escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was done, but the cadets the night before
had tramped around the school building so much
that the footprints were hopelessly mixed. Then
the boys were questioned as to whether or not
they had seen any one dropping from the fire-escape
to the ground, and all answered in the
negative.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will question the hired help and see what
they have to say,&#8221; announced the master of the
school.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE PARADE</h3>
</div>

<p>The inquiries made among the hired help of
Colby Hall produced little results. Some of the
servants were rather scared and declared to Colonel
Colby that they were innocent of any wrong
doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not accusing any one here,&#8221; declared
the master of the Hall. &#8220;I only want to find out,
if possible, who was guilty of this outrageous proceeding.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was found that two men with wagon loads
of supplies for the school had visited the place
during the evening, but neither of these men had
gone any further into the building than the storeroom,
and both had departed as soon as their errands
were finished. Outside of that, so far as
the servants could remember, no outsiders had
been on the premises.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet those footmarks on the window sill
and the fire-escape look as if it had been done by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
an outsider,&#8221; said Captain Dale to the head of the
school.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just possible that it may have been an inside
job and an outside job combined,&#8221; ventured
Professor Grawson.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody in the institution may be in collusion
with some outsider&mdash;some professional
thief. The inside person may have given the outsider
a tip as to when the coast was clear and
may even have stood on guard while the rooms
were being looted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is possible, Professor. But is there any
one in the place that you suspect?&#8221;</p>
<p>At this Professor Grawson shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. So far as I can imagine they are all
thoroughly honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We might institute a general search of all the
buildings,&#8221; announced Captain Dale. &#8220;We can
call all the cadets out on the campus and all the
hired help into the mess room and request them to
remain while the search is going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the hired help may object to that,&#8221;
came from Professor Watson.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they did it would throw suspicion on them,&#8221;
answered Colonel Colby quickly. &#8220;I think the idea
had better be carried out.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the persons in the school were assembled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
as mentioned, and then Captain Dale explained
to the cadets what had been proposed and Colonel
Colby did the same to the hired help.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re certainly welcome to search our
rooms,&#8221; declared Major Jack promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And mine, too,&#8221; added a score of others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I haven&#8217;t anything to conceal,&#8221; put
in Lieutenant Harkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I haven&#8217;t anything to conceal either,&#8221;
came from Brassy Bangs. &#8220;They can search my
room all they please.&#8221; He had announced the loss
of a stickpin and six dollars and a quarter in
cash.</p>
<p>Among the hired help there was more or less
murmuring, one of the old cooks, an Irish woman
who had been in the place since it had been opened,
shaking her head dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t think yez would take me fer
a thief, Colonel Colby,&#8221; said Bridget, gazing at
the head of the school severely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not taking any one for a thief, Mrs.
Mulligan,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;But it would not be
fair to search any of the rooms without searching
all of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure an&#8217; that&#8217;s true fer yez,&#8221; announced the
cook, nodding her head in assent. &#8220;An&#8217; if that&#8217;s
the way ye&#8217;re after lookin&#8217; at it, go ahead and
search me room all ye please. Only don&#8217;t be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
disturbin&#8217; them trinkets I have from me dead
mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>The search was made without delay, all of the
teachers and the cadets who had lost their belongings
taking part. It occupied the rest of the
morning. Every room was gone over carefully,
and when anything in the way of jewelry or other
such articles as had been reported missing were
discovered all those who had suffered were asked
to look on and see if they could identify anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! there&#8217;s a fountain pen that belongs to
me,&#8221; cried one of the boys presently. And then
he added in a crestfallen manner: &#8220;It&#8217;s all right.
I lent that to Bill Latimer a couple of weeks ago
and forgot all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside of this incident the search came to an
end with nothing out of the ordinary happening.
Not an article that had been taken was discovered
in any of the rooms occupied by the cadets
or the hired help. Nor was anything discovered
in any of the other rooms or closets of the institution.</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is puzzling,&#8221; declared Colonel
Colby, after the search had been called off. &#8220;It
looks to me as if a thief had gotten away with
everything he took.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Either that or he has some hiding place which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
we as yet haven&#8217;t unearthed,&#8221; answered Captain
Dale.</p>
<p>After that the hired help were told they might
go, and as soon as possible dinner was served to
the cadets and the teachers. Then, when the
pupils were told to go to their afternoon classes,
Colonel Colby and Captain Dale held a conference
in the office and notified the local police
authorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to do it,&#8221; said Colonel Colby. &#8220;But
there seems to be no help for it. It will certainly
give our institution a black eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do not see how anyone can hold you
responsible for this affair,&#8221; returned Captain
Dale. &#8220;We are as watchful at this institution as
they are anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I shall not permit our cadets to lose
anything by this,&#8221; went on the master of the school
quickly. &#8220;I shall ask each of them to value carefully
what they have lost, and then, if the things
are not recovered before the end of the term, I
will make the loss good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be very nice on your part, Colonel
Colby. And I think it would be a good investment
too,&#8221; added Captain Dale. &#8220;It will prove
to the parents of the cadets that you consider
yourself responsible while they are under your
care.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>When the local authorities came to the school
they went over the ground carefully with Colonel
Colby and some of the others and asked innumerable
questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a number of strangers stopping in
town, mostly traveling salesmen,&#8221; announced the
chief of police. &#8220;I&#8217;ll look &#8217;em up, and also look
up any tramps or any other suspicious characters
that may be hanging around.&#8221; And that for the
time being was all he could say. Soon he and
his men departed.</p>
<p>That evening Jack found a letter in his box
which had been mailed early that morning at
Haven Point. It was from Ruth. There was
also a brief note to Fred which had been sent by
May.</p>
<p>In her communication to the newly-elected
major Ruth congratulated him heartily on his success
and said she hoped soon to see him in a parade
at the head of the battalion. After that she
wrote as follows about the sleighing party that
had been called off:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;I received an invitation to that party from
Lester Bangs and May received an invitation from
Paul Halliday. Jennie Mason, Ida Brierley and
several of the other girls had invitations and they
wanted us to go very much. But, of course, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
did not want to go with such a fellow as Bangs.
Then he came to me and started a report that all
of you Rovers were going to another party with
some of the girls from the town, and that the
party was to take place the same night as our
party. Of course, I did not want to say anything
about it, because I realized that you could do as
you pleased. But I told Bangs positively that I
would not go with him and May told the same
thing to Halliday. Then both of them got quite
ugly and accused you and your cousin of trying
to spoil his outing. I told him you had had nothing
to do with it, but he declared that you had
and that you had better look out or you would get
into hot water. So, Jack, please look out for him
and tell Fred to look out for Halliday and the
others.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>There was more to the letter, and Jack read the
communication with great interest. He felt
greatly relieved to think that Ruth had not intended
to accept Brassy&#8217;s invitation, and later on
he dropped her a note thanking her for her kind
congratulations and telling her that the report of
another party in which the Rovers and some girls
from Haven Point were to participate had been
faked up.</p>
<p>The note received by Fred was on lines similar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
to the communication sent to Jack. He sent word
to May clearing up the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a mean thing for Bangs and Halliday
to do,&#8221; declared the newly-elected captain of
Company C. &#8220;We ought to pitch into them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t afford to do it, Fred, now that I&#8217;m
a major and you&#8217;re a captain,&#8221; was Jack&#8217;s reply.
&#8220;Remember what Colonel Colby said: We must
be models for the other cadets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott! does that mean we can&#8217;t stick up
for our rights?&#8221; demanded the youngest Rover
indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, Fred. If those fellows say anything,
give it back to them. And if they start to
fight, defend yourself just as well as you are
able.&#8221;</p>
<p>As mentioned before, Snopper Duke had been
absent from the Hall during the election for officers
and the celebration which had followed.
When he returned he looked much worried, and
this worry was far from dispelled when he visited
his room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Colby, I, too, have been robbed!&#8221; he
exclaimed, as he came rushing down to the office.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a silver cardcase taken, and also a gold
watch which has been in our family for several
generations, a watch that belonged to my father
and my grandfather.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad, Professor Duke,&#8221; answered the
master of the Hall seriously. &#8220;May I ask what
the articles were worth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose the cardcase was worth more
than a few dollars, but the watch was of gold,
and I presume it must have cost fifty or sixty
dollars. It was an heirloom and I treasured it
highly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am doing my best to find out something
about the robbery,&#8221; said Colonel Colby. &#8220;But
so far all my efforts have been in vain. I intend,
if the articles are not recovered by the time the
school session comes to an end, to pay for everything
that has been stolen.&#8221; And that was all the
master of the Hall could say.</p>
<p>It must be admitted that both Jack and Fred
felt quite proud when the first regular parade of
the battalion took place that spring. The cousins
had, of course, sent home word of the election
and had received permission to purchase new uniforms.
Both looked spick and span as they
marched out at the head of their respective commands.
It was a clear, warm day, and Colonel
Colby announced that the cadets could parade
through Haven Point to Clearwater Hall and return
if they so desired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! That&#8217;s the stuff!&#8221; cried Fred.</p>
<p>And so it was arranged, and one of the teachers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
telephoned over to the girls&#8217; academy, to let
those at that institution know what they might
expect. Then one of the cadets telephoned to
Felix Falstein, the owner of the Haven Point
moving picture theater.</p>
<p>&#8220;Falstein always hangs out his flags for us,&#8221;
said this cadet. &#8220;And he&#8217;ll do it this time, I&#8217;m
sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colby Hall now boasted of a drum and fife
corps of twelve pieces, and they made merry music
as the battalion marched away in the direction of
Haven Point. All but three or four of the cadets
were in the best of spirits.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think marching over to Clearwater Hall is
punk,&#8221; declared Brassy Bangs, with a snarl.
&#8220;Why can&#8217;t they march some place worth while
or just go around the town and let it go at that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess Jack Rover wants to show off before
those girls,&#8221; grumbled Paul Halliday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t go if I could get out of it,&#8221; growled
Brassy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t squeal,&#8221; returned his crony quickly.
&#8220;If you do they&#8217;ll only laugh at us and make us
go anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Attention there, Bangs!&#8221; cried the captain of
Company B, the command to which Brassy belonged.
&#8220;No talking in the ranks!&#8221; And thereupon
the cadets became silent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>As had been anticipated, when the cadets
reached Haven Point they found that Felix Falstein
had outdone himself in the way of decorations.
Not only were several flags displayed
across the front of his theater, but he had strung
two big flags across the street, and between them
placed a banner which he had had painted some
time before and which read:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>WELCOME TO</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>COLBY HALL</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very nice of him,&#8221; remarked Jack, who
was marching at the head of the procession with
Captain Dale on horseback close beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very nice, indeed, Major Rover,&#8221; answered
the military man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if we can&#8217;t come to a halt here and
go through the manual of arms?&#8221; went on the
newly-elected major.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, if you wish to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Battalion halt!&#8221; called out Jack, turning
around and the three companies came to a stop.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>BASEBALL</h3>
</div>

<p>Soon the three companies of the Colby Hall
battalion were in a long line in front of the moving
picture theater. At once a crowd began to
gather until several hundred people were assembled.
Then the cadets were put through the
manual of arms, after which followed some fancy
evolutions in the street in front of the show house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good! Very good, indeed!&#8221; shouted
Felix Falstein, who was present.</p>
<p>His face was beaming and he clapped his hands
loudly, and, taking this hint, the crowd applauded
with vigor. Then the march through Haven
Point was resumed and soon the cadets came in
sight of Clearwater Hall.</p>
<p>They had good reason to feel proud of what
those at the girls&#8217; school had done in their honor.
The big flag was flying from the flagstaff on the
campus and other flags were displayed from the
front of the building. In addition to this the
classes had been dismissed for the time being and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
nearly all the girls were out at the front of the
school, many carrying small flags which they
waved vigorously as the cadets approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t they look grand!&#8221; cried Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Superb!&#8221; added Martha ecstatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do believe Jack has a brand new uniform,&#8221;
came from Ruth, and then she began to cheer
and all the girls joined in.</p>
<p>The cadets had been cautioned to preserve true
military discipline, and they did their best not to
smile and make eyes at their admirers. But it
was hard work, and many a face broke into a grin
impossible to control.</p>
<p>Opposite the school the command came to a
halt, and then Miss Garwood and a number of
her teachers came forward to greet the cadets
and those with them and invite them to the campus.
Here another drill was given, the girls applauding
louder than ever as each movement was
executed with a precision that would have done
credit to the cadets at West Point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s as good as our fathers did at
Putnam Hall,&#8221; declared Mary to her cousin.</p>
<p>Colonel Colby had come along with Captain
Dale, and during the drilling had been in earnest
conversation with Miss Garwood. Then came a
surprise as the cadets were asked to march into
the dining hall of the girls&#8217; school. Here they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
found generous plates of cake and ice-cream, as
well as glasses of refreshing lemonade, awaiting
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, this is the best ever!&#8221; declared Andy,
smacking his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And what a surprise!&#8221; returned Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day we&#8217;ll have to return this compliment,&#8221;
came from Jack. &#8220;My, wouldn&#8217;t it be a
lark to have the girls in our mess hall and treat
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we&#8217;d have to give &#8217;em regular soldiers
fare,&#8221; was Andy&#8217;s dry comment. &#8220;Salt
pork and baked beans and things like that,&#8221; and
he grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing doing!&#8221; declared Fred. &#8220;We&#8217;ll feed
&#8217;em toasted marshmallows and angel cake,&#8221; and
at this sally there was a laugh.</p>
<p>Following the refreshments the cadets were allowed
fifteen minutes in which to walk around
the school campus and mingle with the girl students.
Jack, of course, at once sought out Ruth
to tell her personally how much he appreciated the
letter she had sent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope, Jack, you haven&#8217;t had any more trouble
with Lester Bangs,&#8221; the girl said anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s growling around a little, but that&#8217;s
all,&#8221; answered the young major. &#8220;I&#8217;m not paying
any attention to him, Ruth. I&#8217;m mighty glad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
that you didn&#8217;t accept his invitation,&#8221; and he gave
her a warm glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was awful for him to get up that report
about another party,&#8221; answered the girl. &#8220;Of
course I didn&#8217;t think it was true&mdash;that is, not
what he said about you and your cousins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we let the whole matter drop, Ruth,
and forget Brassy Bangs and his crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m willing to do that, Jack.&#8221; And
then the girl added quickly: &#8220;You&#8217;ve had some
terrible doings over at the Hall, so I have been
told.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the robbery, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Have they discovered anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing. It certainly is a mystery.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the gathering of boys and girls broke up
nearly every one was in the best of humor, the
only exceptions being Brassy Bangs and Paul
Halliday. These two unworthies had done their
best to get on friendly terms with some of the
girls, but had been snubbed in such a manner that
it made them much crestfallen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad when we start back,&#8221; grumbled
Brassy to his crony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s take a walk outside,&#8221; answered
Halliday, and thereupon the pair left the school
grounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about baseball this spring, Jack?&#8221; questioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
his sister just before the cadets were ready
to start.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be out of that this year. There is a new
ruling that officers must step aside and let the
other cadets have a chance on the baseball nine
and the football eleven, as well as have a chance
in the rowing and other contests. Colonel Colby
has an idea that not enough cadets have filled
these various places in the past. He wants to
give every fellow a chance if possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t blame him for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, Martha. I&#8217;m quite content to step
aside so far as baseball is concerned, and so is
Fred. We want to do our best as officers and also
do our best with our studies. You know the folks
at home are expecting us to make real records in
the classrooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that only too well, Jack. Mary and I
are working day and night on our lessons here.
We&#8217;re going to do our best to come out either at
the head of our classes or very near to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is Ruth making out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s doing very well. Of course, she had a
hard struggle to catch up on account of the time
lost because of her eyesight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the parade to Clearwater Hall the
cadets settled down to the usual routine of drills
and studies. But soon there came a call for aspirants
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
to the baseball team, and then talk of the
coming matches with Columbus Academy, Hixley
High, and Longley Academy filled the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! it makes my hands tingle to think about
baseball,&#8221; sighed Fred, when talking the matter
over with Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel the same way,&#8221; answered the young
major. &#8220;But remember, Fred, we can&#8217;t have
everything in this world, and I&#8217;d rather be major
of the school battalion&mdash;at least, for one term.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course! And I&#8217;d rather be captain of Company
C.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gif tells me there are going to be a number
of important changes on the nine,&#8221; went on Jack.
&#8220;A lot of new fellows are clamoring to get on.
They&#8217;re going to have their try-outs in a day or
two.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Jack said was true, and the following
Saturday afternoon a somewhat patched-up first
team played a scrub team. On the scrub, somewhat
to the Rovers&#8217; surprise, were Brassy Bangs
and Paul Halliday.</p>
<p>&#8220;They both claim to know a whole lot about
the game,&#8221; explained Gif. &#8220;So I&#8217;m bound to give
them a try-out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I thought Brassy Bangs came from a
ranch in the West?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So he does. But he told me they frequently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
played baseball on the ranch and that some of the
cowboys were really good players. He said one
of the fellows had once played on one of the Midwest
Leagues.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! there&#8217;s no telling what an up-to-date
cowboy will do these days,&#8221; remarked Andy.
&#8220;Playing baseball, going into the movies and into
vaudeville, and I don&#8217;t know what else!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he finds more money in the doing of
those things than he does in the herding of cows,&#8221;
answered his twin.</p>
<p>The game between the patched-up first nine and
the scrub nine resulted in a tie, 7 to 7. Jack and
his cousins watched the game and had to admit
that Brassy Bangs and Paul Halliday did quite
well&mdash;in fact, much better than had been expected.</p>
<p>After that the practice was continued, Gif, as
head of the athletic association, trying out one
player after another. Then came the final selection
of the regular club to represent Colby Hall,
and Brassy Bangs was given the position of third
baseman while Paul Halliday went to center field.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I ought to be allowed to pitch,&#8221; grumbled
Brassy. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can send &#8217;em in just as
good as any of those other fellows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You pitch a pretty swift ball, I admit,&#8221; returned
Gif. &#8220;But your delivery is rather erratic.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
You put them over the catcher&#8217;s head several
times. If you did that when the bases were full,
it would mean just so many runs coming in.&#8221;
And after that Brassy said no more about pitching.</p>
<p>The first game to be played was on the grounds
of Longley Academy. The cadets journeyed to
the place in carriages and automobiles and on
bicycles, and were joined by quite a number of
the girls from Clearwater Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose Tommy Flanders will pitch?&#8221;
questioned Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. They tell me that last game we had over
here was too much for Flanders and he has given
up the nine entirely. I think they&#8217;ll put in that
new left-hander that they tried at the end of that
game,&#8221; answered Jack. And in this surmise he
was correct.</p>
<p>When the first man came to the bat it was easy
to be seen that both nines were on their mettle.
It was a Colby Hall player who had the stick,
and the left-handed twirler for Longley Academy
struck him out in one-two-three order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! That&#8217;s the way to do it!&#8221; yelled one
of the Longley students. &#8220;Now make it three
straight!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! that was Nevins, one of our best batters,&#8221;
whispered Randy to his cousin Mary.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that, Colby Hall!&#8221; shouted Jack.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to encourage &#8217;em a little bit!&#8221; and
at this there was a smile.</p>
<p>The next man to the bat got a hit and on a
wild pitch managed to reach third. But that was
all that could be done, and Colby Hall retired
without scoring.</p>
<p>During their half of the inning Longley Academy
managed to make two runs, and this was increased
by two more at the end of the fourth
inning. In the meantime the best Colby Hall
could do was to get two hits and bring in one
run.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Four to one in favor of Longley!&#8221;
shouted one of the students from that academy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to tighten up, boys!&#8221; called out
Fred to the members of his school team. &#8220;Tighten
up and show &#8217;em what you can do!&#8221;</p>
<p>The fifth inning passed without a run, and so
did the sixth. Then in the seventh Colby Hall
managed to pass the home plate twice while Longley
Academy scored once. This made the score,
Longley Academy 5, Colby Hall 3.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack, it looks as if Colby Hall might be
beaten!&#8221; said Ruth anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they might have a better fellow than
Brassy Bangs on third,&#8221; put in Fred. &#8220;He
could have put out that last runner with ease.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
That run wasn&#8217;t deserved at all.&#8221; And a number
of others who heard this remark agreed with
the young captain of Company C.</p>
<p>In the eighth inning Colby Hall made one more
run. Then Longley Academy came once more to
the bat, and with two men on first and second and
two out, the batsman knocked a high fly to center
field.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scoop it in, Halliday!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dead easy fly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t get any runs this inning!&#8221;</p>
<p>So the shouts from the Colby Hall boys went
on.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Paul Halliday stepped back
a few paces and got directly under the descending
sphere. Down it came, striking his finger tips and
bouncing over his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s muffed it! He&#8217;s muffed it!&#8221; yelled several
of the Longley Academy contingent gleefully.
&#8220;Run, boys, run!&#8221;</p>
<p>And how the runners did streak from base to
base! And before the ball could be recovered by
the bewildered Halliday the three runs had been
scored.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>SPOUTER IS CORNERED</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah for Longley!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to do it! That makes the score
eight to four!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My, what a muff that was! That center fielder
is a regular butter-fingers!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Soak it to &#8217;em good and plenty, Longley!
Only two men out!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus the hubbub on the part of the students of
Longley Academy continued while the cadets of
Colby Hall had little to say. There were one or
two cries to take Halliday out of the field, but
these were quickly hushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody might muff a ball,&#8221; declared Jack.
&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad, but probably it couldn&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</p>
<p>The very next player to the bat knocked a liner
between first and second and got to second on a
fumble by the first baseman. Then the next
player, after having two strikes called on him,
sent a low one down to center field.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go for it, Halliday! Get it!&#8221; yelled the cadets
eagerly.</p>
<p>Halliday ran for the ball, but was only able
to get it on the first bounce. Then, as he saw the
batsman rounding first for second, he threw the
ball wildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run, Newcomb, run!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There goes the ball for the grandstand!
Hurry up, Markle, and make it a homer!&#8221;</p>
<p>The ball had sailed over the head of the runner
and landed at least ten feet away from the
home plate. The catcher made a dive for it while
the pitcher came to the plate to stop the runners.
But it was too late, and before the sphere could
be sent in both runs had been scored.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zip! Boom! Two more runs for Longley!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to do it, boys! Let&#8217;s snow &#8217;em
under!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take Halliday out!&#8221; was the angry cry of fully
a dozen cadets. &#8220;Take him out! He has no business
on the team!&#8221;</p>
<p>And thereupon amid shouts of derision Paul
Halliday was compelled to quit the field and one
of the substitutes went to take his place.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t my fault! I stepped in a hole,&#8221;
growled Halliday when he came to the bench. He
made a show of limping badly. &#8220;I almost sprained
my ankle.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, your two errors have been very costly,&#8221;
answered Gif coldly.</p>
<p>After that the pitcher for Colby Hall tightened
up, and the next man up was put out on strikes
and the side retired.</p>
<p>With the score 10 to 4 against them, Colby
Hall did what it could to redeem itself during the
last inning. They made one run, followed by
two outs and two hits which brought a man on
first and another on third. Then Brassy Bangs
came to the bat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Brassy, here&#8217;s your chance!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Knock it over the back lots!&#8221;</p>
<p>Brassy set his teeth and swung the bat with a
do-or-dare expression. Then the first ball pitched
came in an outcurve which he swung at in vain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your time!&#8221; called out Gif.</p>
<p>The next was an incurve, but Brassy swung at
it and missed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strike two!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit it, Brassy! Hit it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Knock the cover off!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your time! Wait until you get just what
you want!&#8221;</p>
<p>And thereupon Brassy Bangs did wait&mdash;until
he had three strikes called upon him and was declared
out.</p>
<p>&#8220;That ends the game!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And the score is ten to five in favor of Longley
Academy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! That&#8217;s the time we showed Colby
Hall what we can do!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Longley Academy boys went wild in their
enthusiasm and danced around the field like so
many Indians. And they had good cause to be
elated, for they remembered only too well the
drubbing they had gotten at the hands of Colby
Hall the season before when Jack and Fred had
made such records for themselves.</p>
<p>The Colby Hall cadets could say nothing
against the record made by the Longley nine.
They had put up a stiff fight from the start and
deserved their laurels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our defeat was largely due to Halliday and
Bangs,&#8221; declared Spouter. &#8220;Between them they
let in at least five runs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly the truth,&#8221; answered Dan Soppinger.
&#8220;If I were Gif I&#8217;d read the riot act to
those two players.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be too hard on them,&#8221;
came from Jack. &#8220;Anybody might have muffed
that ball down in center field, and any of us
might have struck out as Brassy did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But both of them made several other errors,&#8221;
put in Walt Baxter.</p>
<p>On the way back to Colby Hall the students
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
were free in their comments on the game, and
there were many uncomplimentary things said
about Brassy and Halliday. Those two players
tried to excuse themselves as best they could;
but a baseball player who has not made good seldom
gets any sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you both another chance in the game
with Hixley High,&#8221; said Gif at last, in talking the
matter over with the two players. &#8220;But if you
make a single error it will cost you your positions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The game with Hixley High came off on the
following Saturday and was won by the narrow
score of 7 to 6. In the second inning Halliday
made another wild throw from center to second,
and Brassy Bangs made a bad fumble in the fourth
inning, and as a consequence both were retired
and substitutes put in their places.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was certainly a narrow squeak,&#8221; declared
Fred, when the game was over and the boys were
preparing to celebrate that evening. &#8220;I believe if
Gif had kept Brassy and Halliday on the team
we would have lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we may lose some other games even
so,&#8221; said Jack. And he was right. Out of a
total of seven games played with the other schools
of that vicinity that season Colby Hall won but
four.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t win every year,&#8221; declared
Randy. &#8220;And we&#8217;re half a game to the good anyway,
and that&#8217;s something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly better than being half a game
behind,&#8221; answered his twin.</p>
<p>While these matters were going on Colonel
Colby and Captain Dale had been doing everything
possible with the aid of the local police,
and also a private detective who had been called
in, to solve the mystery concerning the robbery
at the school. But all efforts seemed to be in
vain. Not a trace of the person or persons who
had committed the crime could be found. It was
a great mystery.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll have to settle with all of the boys
and with Professor Duke,&#8221; said Colonel Colby
to his head assistant. &#8220;And there I suppose the
matter will have to be dropped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later on he took up the various claims and
paid each one of them in cash.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very thankful to you for this, Colonel
Colby,&#8221; declared Snopper Duke, when he received
his money. &#8220;It will come in quite handy, I assure
you. And yet I am much distressed over
that watch which once belonged to my grandfather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope it is brought to light some day,
Professor,&#8221; answered the master of the Hall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
&#8220;And if it is then you can pay me back for it,&#8221;
and he smiled faintly.</p>
<p>In those days a number of the cadets noticed
that Snopper Duke seemed to be much preoccupied.
He paid hardly any attention to what his
pupils were doing and was so absent-minded that
often he answered the simplest questions in the
most ridiculous manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s certainly got something on his mind,&#8221;
was Fred&#8217;s comment. &#8220;I must say I&#8217;d like to
know what it can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll never know,&#8221; answered Jack.
&#8220;But because of what Colonel Colby said I&#8217;m certainly
going to be careful how I treat him. He
may have more of a load on his mind and heart
than any of us imagine.&#8221;</p>
<p>It now lacked but ten days to the end of the
term, and the boys were busy finishing up with
the examinations in the various classes and also
in writing the final essays to be handed in. All
had worked hard to make a showing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think! Only ten days more!&#8221; exclaimed
Andy, throwing a grammar across his room at
Randy. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it make you feel fine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure does!&#8221; answered his twin, catching the
book and sending it back so quickly that his
brother was hit in the stomach. &#8220;And that puts
me in mind, Andy. Why not get at Spouter and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
make him tell us what he&#8217;s got in mind about our
vacation this summer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do it! Come on! We&#8217;ll get Fred and
Jack and Gif and go and pound it out of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>All alive with their scheme, the twins burst in
upon the other Rovers while they were busy writing
their essays and broached the subject. The
others agreed, and Fred ran off to get Gif. Then
the whole crowd rounded up Spouter, and grabbing
him by the arms fairly forced him along the
corridor and into the Rover boys&#8217; sitting room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Spouter, you&#8217;ve got to tell us!&#8221; declared
Randy. &#8220;No more secrets!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, gee! Is that it?&#8221; was Spouter&#8217;s reply.
&#8220;I thought you wanted to borrow a nickel from
me, or something like that,&#8221; and he smiled feebly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on now, Spouter! Give it to us
straight,&#8221; demanded Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more sawing and fiddling,&#8221; put in Andy.
&#8220;We want straight goods. Where are we going
this summer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going with me,&#8221; answered Spouter,
with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve told us about three thousand times.
But where are we going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going home first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pound him, fellows, pound him! Throw him
down and pound him good!&#8221; and thereupon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
whole crowd pounced upon the luckless schemer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on! Hold on! Let me up!&#8221; spluttered
Spouter. &#8220;Let me up, and I&#8217;ll tell you everything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest?&#8221; demanded Andy. &#8220;If you fool us
this time we&#8217;ll drag you to the bathroom and
duck you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cross my heart!&#8221; panted Spouter. &#8220;Now let
me up!&#8221;</p>
<p>The others allowed him to arise and then forced
him into an easy chair in the corner and all stood
over him menacingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to spend your vacation at a new
place which was purchased by my dad only a few
months ago,&#8221; answered Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what place is that?&#8221; came in a chorus
from his chums.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big Horn Ranch.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>GOOD-BYE TO SCHOOL</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Big Horn Ranch! That sounds interesting!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of a place is it, Spouter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you must have thousands of heads
of cattle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about horses, Spouter? We&#8217;ll have
enough mounts, sha&#8217;n&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any good hunting or fishing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop! Stop! What are you trying to do?&#8221;
spluttered Spouter. &#8220;Trying to drown me in a
flood of questions? Why don&#8217;t you ask one
thing at a time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, where is the ranch and how are we going
to get to it?&#8221; questioned Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how big is it?&#8221; put in Fred.</p>
<p>And then came another flood of questions until
poor Spouter placed his hands to his ears in dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t answer everything at once,&#8221; he said
finally. &#8220;So you&#8217;d better let me tell what I know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
in my own way. Big Horn Ranch is located out
in Montana, and it comprises a thousand acres or
more&mdash;how large I don&#8217;t exactly know. To get
there you journey by rail to a little jumping-off
place called Four Rocks, and then you have to
ride or drive to the ranch, which is four or five
miles away. The nearest town of any size is
Arrow Junction, which is quite a distance off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is it your dad bought a place like that?&#8221;
broke in Gif. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know he was interested
in ranches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he has always liked outdoor life&mdash;you all
know that. And this ranch came to him in rather
an unexpected way. There were two brothers who
were interested in a speculation in which my dad
was interested, too. My dad advanced a lot of
money to these brothers, and as they couldn&#8217;t pay
up in cash they asked him if he wouldn&#8217;t take the
ranch off their hands by allowing them an additional
thirty thousand dollars. So he made a trip
out there in company with another man who knew
all about ranches and then he concluded to buy,
and did so. So now we own Big Horn Ranch,
and the family expects to spend a large part of
each summer there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your father said we could all go out there
with you?&#8221; questioned Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He told me to invite you four Rovers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
and also Gif. And that isn&#8217;t all,&#8221; went on
Spouter. &#8220;He&#8217;s invited all your folks out there,
too. He&#8217;s going to make a great big house-party
of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our folks!&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;What do you
mean? They can&#8217;t all go. Uncle Dick is just
back from Texas, and somebody has got to look
after the offices in New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been arranged that your father and
mother are to go along first, Fred, and later on
Randy and Andy&#8217;s father and mother are to come
out. Then, when they go back to New York, it&#8217;s
possible that Jack&#8217;s folks will come West before
the season is over. Gif&#8217;s folks have not decided
on what they can do, but will let us know in a
week or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what about the girls?&#8221; questioned Fred
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, they are to go along, too. Martha
will go with Mary and her folks, and May will,
of course, be with my mother, and she is going
to try to get Ruth to go with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Ruth said she was going somewhere else,&#8221;
remarked Jack, and his face showed disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that, Jack. But I think May can get
the Stevensons to allow her to go. Anyway, all
the girls are going to try.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>After that the Rovers and Gif asked many
other questions concerning Big Horn Ranch and
Spouter told them all he could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I know only what dad has written
and what was said about the ranch before we
purchased it. I suppose I&#8217;ll learn a lot more as
soon as I go home, and then I&#8217;ll let you know
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! we ought to have the best time ever,&#8221;
exclaimed Andy gleefully, as he caught Spouter
by the shoulders and commenced to dance him
around the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was certainly well worth waiting for,
Spouter,&#8221; came from Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you managed to keep it a secret,&#8221;
put in Randy. &#8220;I&#8217;d have been bustin&#8217; to
tell it every minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I had a job of it, believe me, with you
fellows dinging at me all the time,&#8221; was Spouter&#8217;s
answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you suppose we can start?&#8221; questioned
Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;That, of course, will depend a good deal on
you and your folks,&#8221; answered Spouter. &#8220;My
folks are already out there, getting the ranch in
readiness for visitors. I suppose you&#8217;ll want to
go home over the Fourth of July, but maybe you&#8217;ll
be able to start West right after that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what could hold us back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the ranch house big enough to accommodate
such a large crowd?&#8221; questioned Jack.
&#8220;There are a lot of us, remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so. You see the ranch is really a combination
of two ranches, the buildings of one
ranch were located near the eastern boundary
while the buildings of the other ranch were set
equally close to the western boundary, and as a
result the two sets of buildings are not very far
apart. Father and mother didn&#8217;t know exactly
what they were going to do. They said they
would either divide the party between the two
ranch houses or otherwise send all the hired help
to one of the houses and keep our whole party at
the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be nice if we could stick together,&#8221;
said Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it won&#8217;t make much difference, because,
as I understand it, it&#8217;s only a short walk from one
set of buildings to the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this revelation from Spouter it was difficult
for the Rover boys and Gif to settle down
once more to their essay writing and their examinations.
However, all did their best, and when
the school term came to an end each had made a
creditable showing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be proud to take this card home and show
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
it,&#8221; said Fred, as he examined the pasteboard
which had been handed to him.</p>
<p>Out of a possible 100 per cent. he had received
94 per cent. Jack had passed with 92 per cent.,
Randy with 89 per cent., and Andy with 88 per
cent. This last figure was the one also reached
by Gif. Spouter, who was naturally a very studious
person, had passed with the highest mark of
the class&mdash;96 per cent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, eighty-eight per cent. isn&#8217;t as good as it
might be, but it&#8217;s a good deal better than lots of
the fellows made,&#8221; remarked Andy. &#8220;And it&#8217;s a
long way from the failure mark&mdash;below seventy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course the boys had already talked over the
telephone to the girls, and then it leaked out that
all of those at Clearwater Hall knew about Big
Horn Ranch and that Ruth was almost certain
that she could go with the Rover girls and May.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we all go together we had better charter a
private car,&#8221; remarked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that would be something worth while!&#8221;
put in Fred, with satisfaction. &#8220;Let&#8217;s put it up to
our folks!&#8221;</p>
<p>Two days before the boys were to leave for
home, Randy saw a messenger boy deliver a telegram
to Snopper Duke. The professor read the
brief communication and then Randy saw him
stagger up against a chair in the hallway as if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
about to fall. He rushed forward and caught the
professor by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the trouble, Professor?&#8221; he questioned
kindly, for he could see that Snopper Duke was
in deep distress.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash; Don&#8217;t mind me, Rover,&#8221; stammered
the teacher. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little bad news, that&#8217;s
all. And coming on top of some other bad news
I&#8217;ve received lately I can hardly stand it,&#8221; and
with these words Snopper Duke turned and went
slowly upstairs to his room. Half an hour later
he was closeted with Colonel Colby and then drove
away from the Hall; and that was the last the
Colby Hall cadets saw of the strange teacher during
that term.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s certainly got something on his mind,&#8221;
said Randy, in telling the others of the incident.
&#8220;And I must confess I&#8217;m growing really sorry
for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the next day came another surprise for the
Rovers. All of them were out on the campus
when they saw Brassy Bangs leap a side hedge
and start toward the school. At the same time
they saw a tall man wearing a slouch hat hurrying
off in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! there is that fellow Brassy had trouble
with in town,&#8221; exclaimed Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just look at Brassy!&#8221; whispered Fred, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
the youth had passed them and gone into the Hall.
&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s as pale as a ghost!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is a mystery about Brassy and
that strange man,&#8221; was Jack&#8217;s comment. &#8220;Just
as much of a mystery as about Professor Duke&#8217;s
doings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon the boys were busy packing up, getting
ready to leave. Then came the usual jolly times
just previous to saying good-bye to their fellow-cadets
and the teachers. The students were to
scatter in all directions and the majority of them
expected to have a glorious time during the summer
vacation. Phil Franklin was to go back to
the oil fields, to visit his father.</p>
<p>At the railroad station the Rovers met Mary
and Martha and also some of the other girls, and
here many good-byes were said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you get a chance to get out to Big
Horn Ranch,&#8221; said Jack to Ruth.</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I, Jack. But I haven&#8217;t received permission
to go yet. If I don&#8217;t get there you must write
to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly will, Ruth. And you must write
also. But come out if you possibly can.&#8221;</p>
<p>The home-coming of the Rovers was, as usual,
made a gala event. The three mothers had come
down to meet their children and there was a happy
reunion at the Grand Central Terminal, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
the three families drove off in their automobiles
to their homes on Riverside Drive. A little later
the fathers of the young folks came in from
downtown, and that night there was a grand dinner
spread for all in Tom Rover&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, it&#8217;s good to be home once more,
Mother!&#8221; cried Andy, and hugged his parent from
one side while his twin hugged her from the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s mighty good to think that we can all
be together,&#8221; came from Jack. &#8220;It&#8217;s so different
from what it was when the war was going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t speak of the war! I never
want to hear of it again!&#8221; put in Martha.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to think we&#8217;re all going out to Big Horn
Ranch!&#8221; burst out Fred. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that just the
grandest ever?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>ON THE WAY WEST</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re off for Big Horn Ranch at last!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is a grand prospect, eh, Jack? We
ought to have barrels of fun on the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Randy, it certainly ought to make a
dandy vacation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fairly itching to get on horseback,&#8221; put
in Andy. &#8220;What dandy rides we shall have!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll get a chance to break in a
broncho,&#8221; put in Fred, with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare do such a thing, Fred Rover!&#8221;
burst out his sister Mary. &#8220;Most likely the bronco
would break your neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we won&#8217;t bust any broncos until we get
to the ranch,&#8221; came with a smile from Fred&#8217;s
father, who had followed the young people into
the sleeping car at the Grand Central Terminal.</p>
<p>It was the day of their departure for the West,
and the young folks were quivering with suppressed
excitement. Sam Rover and his wife
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
headed the party, which consisted of the four
boys and the two girls.</p>
<p>Fourth of July had been spent rather quietly
at home preparing for the trip. Of course, Andy
and Randy had had some fun, especially with fireworks
in the evening, but otherwise the young
folks had been too preoccupied with their arrangements
for getting away to pay special attention
to the national holiday.</p>
<p>It had been arranged that only the Rovers mentioned
above should at first make the trip to the
ranch, and Gif and Spouter were to meet them in
Chicago, where they would change cars for Montana.
Tom Rover and his wife were to come to
the ranch two weeks later and bring with them
May Powell and Ruth Stevenson. Later still it
was barely possible that Dick Rover and his wife
would come West.</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s idea of chartering a private car had
fallen through because not all of the party to
meet at Big Horn Ranch were to go at the same
time. But those now gathered had seats at one
end of the sleeper along with a private compartment
for Mrs. Rover and the two girls, so they
were all comfortable.</p>
<p>The boys were in the best of spirits; and for
a while Sam Rover had his hands full making
Andy and Randy behave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we strike a lot of lively cowboys, Uncle
Sam,&#8221; broke out Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ll find some of the cowboys too
lively,&#8221; was the answer.</p>
<p>Jack and Fred, as well as their sisters, were
disappointed that May and Ruth had not been able
to accompany them, but they were glad to know
that the others would follow later to the ranch.</p>
<p>Soon New York was left behind and the train
was speeding along the Hudson River on its way
to Albany.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think! By this time to-morrow we&#8217;ll be
in Chicago,&#8221; remarked Martha. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it wonderful
how you can cover such a distance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, I almost wish we were going
out there in an auto,&#8221; returned Fred. &#8220;That
would be a trip worth taking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially if you had to put on all the extra
tires along the way, Fred,&#8221; added Andy, with a
grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I guess I could do that, too, if I had
to,&#8221; answered the youngest Rover boy quickly.
&#8220;But the roads from here to Chicago are pretty
good, they tell me, so I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d have
many punctures or blow-outs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a trip would be dandy, only it might
take more time than we&#8217;d care to spend on the
way right now,&#8221; remarked Jack. &#8220;Personally I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
want to get out to Big Horn Ranch as soon as
possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly my sentiments,&#8221; came from Randy.
&#8220;Me for the mountains and plains and a life in
the open air!&#8221;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style=' margin-left:4em;'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Oh, for a life in the open air,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Under the skies so blue and fair!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>sang out Andy gayly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, Andy is bursting into poetry!&#8221; cried
Fred. &#8220;What&#8217;s going to happen next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he ate something that didn&#8217;t agree with
him,&#8221; giggled Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better bottle up that poetry stuff,
Andy,&#8221; remarked Jack. &#8220;Remember we&#8217;re going
out to a ranch owned by Songbird Powell, and he
was nicknamed Songbird while at Putnam Hall
because he was always bursting out into home-made
poetry. Maybe we&#8217;ll get a surplus of it
when we get out to the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lunch was had in the dining car, and almost
before the young folks realized it the train was
rolling into Albany. Here an extra car was attached,
and then they were off on the long journey
through the Mohawk Valley to Buffalo,
Cleveland, and the great city by the Lakes.</p>
<p>After the train had passed Utica Andy and
Randy, who found it hard to sit still, took a walk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
through the cars from end to end, thinking they
might meet somebody they knew. They were
gone so long that Sam Rover became a little worried
over them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll hunt them up,&#8221; he said to his wife.
&#8220;For all we know they may have gotten into some
mischief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More than likely they&#8217;re into something,&#8221; answered
Mrs. Grace Rover. &#8220;They&#8217;re exactly like
their father Tom when it comes to stirring things
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Rover was just leaving his seat when Andy
and Randy came back to the car. Their faces
showed their excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think!&#8221; exclaimed Randy, as he
dropped into a seat. &#8220;We met that same fellow
who was threatening Brassy Bangs at Haven
Point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was Brassy with him?&#8221; questioned Jack
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But two other men were with him, and
it&#8217;s a tough crowd, believe me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221; questioned Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two cars behind. And from the way the
three talked they must have gotten on at Albany.
The fellow Brassy had something to do with is
tough enough, but the other two men seem to be
much worse. By their talk, they are cattle men,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
and I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they have been
cowboys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that isn&#8217;t all!&#8221; added Andy. &#8220;They spoke
about going to Arrow Junction!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrow Junction!&#8221; repeated Fred. &#8220;Why,
that&#8217;s the town that Spouter said was nearest to
Big Horn Ranch!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What were they going to do at Arrow Junction?&#8221;
questioned Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got some sort of a deal on for handling
horses and cattle. We couldn&#8217;t make out
exactly what it was,&#8221; answered Randy. &#8220;But
they certainly are a tough bunch. It looks to me
as if they might have been drinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear them mention Brassy?&#8221; asked
Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But that fellow who met Brassy at Haven
Point, the chap called Bud Haddon, told the others
he had struck a real snap in the East. And
one of the others answered that he had noticed
that Bud was rather flush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly a mystery what that fellow had
to do with Brassy,&#8221; remarked Jack. And then
of a sudden his face became a study.</p>
<p>A sudden thought had occurred to him, and it
was such a horrible one that he was inclined to
force it from his mind. And yet it came bobbing
up time and again until Fred, who was sitting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
beside his cousin, noticed that something was on
his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you thinking of, Jack? Ruth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Fred. I was thinking of that fellow who
met Brassy Bangs in Haven Point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wondering, I suppose, why Brassy let
him have some money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Partly that and partly something else, Fred.
But it&#8217;s so horrible I hate to think of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what do you mean, Jack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you must know, it just happened to
cross my mind that that Bud Haddon was hanging
around Haven Point and was seen around the
school several times just when Colby Hall was
robbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the young major uttered these words in a
low tone of voice, Fred stared at him in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;My gracious, Jack, that&#8217;s so!&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it queer we didn&#8217;t think of it before? From
what Andy and Randy tell of how that fellow
treated Brassy I wouldn&#8217;t put it past him to be
a bad one. But if he had anything to do with
the robbery at the school, do you think Brassy
had, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to think, Fred. Brassy
never struck me as that sort of a fellow. He&#8217;s
loud-mouthed and he&#8217;s got a big opinion of himself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
and all that, but I never put him down as
being crooked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither did I. But you must remember one
thing&mdash;that fellow was dinging at him for money.
He said Brassy must get it or there would be
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m remembering that, Fred. I must
confess it looks pretty bad. But I don&#8217;t think
we had better say anything until we know more
about the men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s pump Andy and Randy all we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred&#8217;s suggestion was followed out, and the
four Rover boys talked the matter over among
themselves. The twins were as much surprised
as Fred had been when Jack mentioned what was
in his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, that Bud Haddon may be the guilty one!&#8221;
burst out Randy. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t we think of this
before? Colonel Colby might have put a detective
on his trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think we ought to send him a telegram
or anything like that?&#8221; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do much good. What would be
better, I think, is for us to watch the man and
see if we can find out more about him. If he is
going to Arrow Junction we may have a chance
of learning more about him out there. Did he
expect to stay at the Junction?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think so&mdash;or at least in that vicinity. The
whole crowd is bound for some ranch out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if we learn anything of importance
against the fellow we can have the local authorities
make an investigation,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh! wouldn&#8217;t it be queer if that fellow really
had robbed Colby Hall and if Brassy was mixed
up in it?&#8221; remarked Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be terrible if Brassy was guilty,&#8221; answered
Jack. &#8220;It would just about ruin him forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Jack. Suppose you and I walk back
and see if we can locate the fellows,&#8221; suggested
Fred. &#8220;They don&#8217;t know us, so they won&#8217;t be
suspicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we might try it,&#8221; was the young major&#8217;s
reply.</p>
<p>And thereupon he and his cousin walked
through the cars to the place where the twins
said Bud Haddon and his two companions were
seated.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>IN THE SADDLE</h3>
</div>

<p>The two boys located the three men without
any trouble. They were seated near the end of
the car where there was a water cooler, and here
the two lads stopped to fumble for a minute or
two over the paper drinking cups and then to take
their time getting a drink.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we ought to make a lot of money on
that deal, Noxley,&#8221; they heard Bud Haddon say.
&#8220;That is, provided we mind what we&#8217;re doin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;ll be no trip-up this time,&#8221; answered
the man called Noxley.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wonderin&#8217; how many horses there
would be that we could sell,&#8221; put in the third man
of the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard we could get at least twenty, Jenks.
Of course, I can&#8217;t tell exactly until I&#8217;ve looked
over the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, twenty head of horses and two hundred
head of cattle are not to be sneezed at,&#8221; answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
the man called Jenks. &#8220;A fine piece of business,
I&#8217;ll say,&#8221; and he laughed shrewdly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long do you expect to stay at Arrow
Junction before you go out to Bimbel&#8217;s Ranch?&#8221;
questioned Noxley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not more &#8217;n three or four days. I&#8217;m expectin&#8217;
word from Bimbel as soon as I reach the Junction,
and then I&#8217;ll know just what he wants us
to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing I want understood,&#8221; went on Jenks
crossly. &#8220;This time I get all that&#8217;s comin&#8217; to me&mdash;no
holdin&#8217; back!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I want the same, remember that,&#8221; put in
Noxley sourly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get your full share&mdash;no fear of that,&#8221;
said Haddon reassuringly. &#8220;Only remember,
you&#8217;ve got to do your full share of the work, too.
No shirkin&#8217; at the last minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t want to be takin&#8217; too many
chances,&#8221; and Jenks shook his uncombed head
dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to take chances in this game,
Jenks. You can&#8217;t expect the hens to lay eggs
right in your hands,&#8221; and Haddon chuckled at his
little joke.</p>
<p>After that the men talked about a good time
they had had in Albany the evening before. They
said nothing further of what they expected to do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
in the West nor did Haddon mention Haven
Point or Brassy Bangs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We might as well go back,&#8221; whispered Jack
to Fred, after they had remained as long at the
water cooler as they dared. The men had glanced
at them carelessly, but had evidently given them
scant attention.</p>
<p>When the two lads returned to the others they
held a consultation, and then laid the whole case
before Fred&#8217;s father. Sam Rover listened with
interest, and his face became a study.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just possible that your guess may be correct
and this fellow Haddon may be guilty of
robbing Colby Hall. But it would be sheer foolishness
to accuse the fellow unless you had sufficient
evidence against him. This talk about
horses and cattle may be a perfectly legitimate
affair. However, when we get to the ranch we
can look into the matter further and find out what
sort of place this Bimbel&#8217;s ranch is and what the
men really intend to do while there. That may
give us a better line on this Bud Haddon and the
others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to watch that crowd as long as they
travel with us,&#8221; said Jack, and the other lads
said they would do the same.</p>
<p>A night was spent on the train, all the boys
sleeping soundly, and in the middle of the forenoon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
they rolled into the great station at Chicago.
Here the lads kept their eyes wide open and saw
Haddon and his two companions walk away,
dresssuit-cases in hand. Nor did they reappear
when the Rovers, an hour later, hurried for the
train which was to take them further westward.
Evidently the three men were going to take some
other train to Montana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they are! We&#8217;ve been waiting for you
folks!&#8221; came the cry, and Spouter rushed up to
the Rovers, followed by Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho for the glorious West!&#8221; put in Gif.
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you fellows anxious to get there?&#8221; he
questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anxious doesn&#8217;t express it!&#8221; answered Andy.
&#8220;Why, all night long I was riding broncos and
lassoing wild cattle!&#8221; and he grinned.</p>
<p>Sleeping-car accommodations had been reserved
for all of the crowd, and they were soon making
themselves at home. Then, as the train sped westward,
the Rovers told their chums about Bud
Haddon.</p>
<p>&#8220;That certainly is interesting,&#8221; said Gif. &#8220;Just
the same, I can&#8217;t think that Brassy Bangs is a
thief. Why, if you&#8217;ll remember, he said he had
been robbed himself!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He might have said that just to throw dust
in the eyes of the public,&#8221; answered Spouter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
&#8220;To my mind it will certainly be a good thing
to keep our eyes open for this fellow Haddon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trip to Montana took the best part of
three days, and every one in the party enjoyed
the journey thoroughly. They often went out
to the observation end of the train, there to view
the endless panorama of prairies and mountains,
forests and streams, as they sped swiftly past.
The magnificent view impressed Spouter as much
as anybody.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sublime&mdash;stupendously sublime,&#8221; he murmured
over and over again. &#8220;The thoughts that
well up in my bosom at such a sight as this are
beyond the power of words to express. When I
view these immense plains, these mountain tops
fading away in the distance, these wild and weird
torrents rushing over the rocks, and these trackless
forests with often not a human abode in
sight, I cannot but think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That there is room here for every man, woman
and child in the city of New York and then
some,&#8221; finished Andy. &#8220;Gee, how can they stick
in one or two miserable cubby-holes of rooms
when we have all this land to draw on!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what gets me,&#8221; put in Gif. &#8220;But they
do it. And I&#8217;m told that a whole lot of &#8217;em would
rather die huddled together than live out here
where neighbors are miles apart.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>The through train took them only as far as
Arrow Junction. Here they alighted and then
boarded a little side line, running through the
hills to a dozen small stations, including Four
Rocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t so nice,&#8221; sighed Martha, when all
had piled into one of the two little cars which
comprised the train. Their baggage had been
put in the other car, which was a combination
baggage and smoking car. There were but a few
other passengers in the car, including one fat
woman with two small and exceedingly dirty children.
There were also several cowboys, and a
Chinaman who looked as if he might be a cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think dad has a Chink at our ranch,&#8221; said
Spouter. &#8220;Anyway, he wrote he thought he&#8217;d hire
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had telegraphed ahead, so that there
might be some one to meet them when they arrived
at Four Rocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly an odd name for a railroad station,&#8221;
remarked Mrs. Rover to her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four Rocks sounds substantial enough,&#8221; he
returned, with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it much of a town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not likely to be any town at all. Perhaps
a little railroad station and possibly one store,
which, of course, would also be the post-office.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>Sam Rover&#8217;s idea of Four Rocks proved to be
correct. Situated near a ridge of rocks was a
small railroad station with a telegraph office and
baggage room attached, a water tower, and opposite
to the station were two low buildings, one a
general store and the other a place where there had
once been a saloon and dance hall, but which was
now closed up.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s my dad now!&#8221; cried Spouter excitedly,
as he leaped off the train. And the next minute
he was running towards an automobile in which
sat his parent. &#8220;Where is ma?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;She remained at the house to see that everything
was in readiness when you got there,&#8221; answered
Songbird Powell, as he shook hands with
his son.</p>
<p>Close to the automobile stood a number of
horses, all saddled. On one sat a bronzed cowboy,
who grinned broadly at the boys and tipped
his hat rather awkwardly to Mrs. Rover and the
girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my foreman, Joe Jackson,&#8221; said Songbird
Powell. &#8220;Joe, this is Mr. and Mrs. Rover,
and these are the Rover boys and their sisters,
and this is my son and another of his chums. I
guess you&#8217;ll get better acquainted a little later on,&#8221;
and he smiled broadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s to ride on horseback?&#8221; questioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
Andy quickly, &#8220;We can&#8217;t all get into that
machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You boys can all ride with Joe,&#8221; answered
Spouter&#8217;s father. &#8220;I thought you&#8217;d rather do
that than anything else. The girls and the others
can ride with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know I don&#8217;t want to ride on
horseback, Uncle John?&#8221; cried Martha gayly.
She often called this intimate chum of her father
&#8220;uncle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Martha, you&#8217;d better ride with us now,&#8221;
put in Mrs. Rover hastily. &#8220;You can do your
horseback riding later on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I was only fooling, Aunt Grace,&#8221; the girl
replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just crazy to see Big Horn Ranch, Uncle
John,&#8221; came from Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you&#8217;ll like it,&#8221; returned Songbird
Powell. &#8220;I want every one of you to have the
best times ever while you&#8217;re here.&#8221; His eyes
glistened. &#8220;We ought to have a regular old-fashioned
reunion.&#8221; And then, unable to control
himself, he broke out into a bit of his old-time
doggerel.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah, Songbird, that certainly sounds natural!&#8221;
cried Sam Rover, slapping his old chum
on the shoulder. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to give us more
of that later on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t spent much time on verses the last
few years, Sam,&#8221; answered Songbird. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
too busy attending to business. But maybe I&#8217;ll
get back to it while loafing around the ranch,&#8221;
he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are any other people coming to the ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, one other person. And I think you&#8217;ll
be very much surprised to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you had better wait until he arrives,&#8221;
returned Songbird Powell, and began to grin as
though the thought of what was coming pleased
him.</p>
<p>The older persons and the girls waited until
all the boys were safely in the saddle, and then
Songbird Powell started the automobile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m leaving them in your care, Joe,&#8221; he called
back to his foreman, as he moved along.
&#8220;Bring &#8217;em to the ranch in safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust me,&#8221; called out the foreman promptly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll be at the ranch almost as soon as you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t ride the horses to death,&#8221; shouted
back Songbird. And then in a few minutes more
the automobile disappeared in the distance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The boys will certainly enjoy that horseback
riding,&#8221; said Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad of it,&#8221; answered Songbird Powell, and
as the automobile rolled onward he murmured
gaily:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style=' margin-left:4em;'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;An elephant sat on a bamboo tree</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>And he was as happy as he could be.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8216;To travel,&#8217; said he, &#8216;is awfully punk</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Unless you remember to take your trunk!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what a funny rhyme!&#8221; giggled Martha.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to write that down in my scrap
book,&#8221; returned her cousin, and at this remark
Spouter&#8217;s father looked real pleased.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah for Big Horn Ranch!&#8221; shouted
Randy, waving his cap. &#8220;Come on if you&#8217;re
ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t work your horses too hard at the start,&#8221;
cautioned Joe Jackson. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good five miles
to the ranch, and part of it is rather tough climbing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s tough climbing how is the automobile
going to get there?&#8221; questioned Jack quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ll go around by the river road. But
that is eight miles longer. We&#8217;ll take the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then maybe we can get there first after all!&#8221;
broke in Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can try, anyhow,&#8221; answered the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
foreman of the ranch. &#8220;Do all of you boys know
how to ride?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure we do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then forward it is!&#8221; And away rode the
foreman with Jack and Spouter on either side of
him and the others following close behind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>AT BIG HORN RANCH</h3>
</div>

<p>The way lay along a flat stretch of prairie
bordering the river, and then up into the hills.
The brushwood in the immediate neighborhood
was scanty, but in the distance they could see
some scrub timber backed up by a stretch of
forest. Far to the westward they could see the
distant mountains over which the sun was now
setting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, you fellows, come on! Don&#8217;t lag
behind!&#8221; shouted Spouter, and set off at a brisk
pace along the well-defined trail leading to the
ranch.</p>
<p>Joe Jackson, having seen that all of them could
ride well, was quite willing to let them set their
own pace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only look and see where you&#8217;re going!&#8221; he
shouted. &#8220;And remember at the split in the trail
to take the one on the right.&#8221; And then he allowed
them to plunge on ahead, but kept his eyes
on everything they were doing.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

&#8220;OFF TO THE EASTWARD YOU CAN SEE A BIT OF OUR RANGE.&#8221;<br />

</p>
</div>

<p>Two miles from the station the boys found
they had quite a climb, and here they were forced
to slow down. A little later they reached the top
of the first hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;There off to the eastward you can see a bit
of our range,&#8221; said the ranch foreman, pointing
with his finger. &#8220;And those cattle yonder are our
cattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the time they reached the foot of the first
hill the sun was setting beyond the mountains in
the west and the long shadows were creeping
across the trail and over the forest beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;This must be some dark trail at night,&#8221; remarked
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dark as a tunnel,&#8221; answered Joe Jackson.
&#8220;You have to carry a lantern or a flashlight when
you try to ride it after dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever get held up?&#8221; questioned Fred curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nary a hold-up, lad,&#8221; answered the foreman,
with a grin. &#8220;We leave all that to the movie
men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever have a moving picture company
out here?&#8221; asked Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we had one crowd out here last year.
They stayed around about six weeks taking some
sort of a drama, as they called it. It was funny,&#8221;
added the foreman, with a chuckle. &#8220;The leading
lady was scared to death of horses, and yet she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
had to do a little riding. The man who was having
the pictures taken wanted her to smile while
she was cantering along. But that smile, believe
me, wasn&#8217;t anything to brag about. They ought
to have brought along some leading lady who
liked horses and knew all about &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they use any of your outfit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they used a few of our cowboys in a
round-up. They wanted me to go into some of
the pictures, but I told &#8217;em there was nothing
doing&mdash;that I was here to manage the ranch and
not make moving pictures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many men on the place?&#8221; asked Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have six at present. But the boss is thinking
of getting some more and increasing the
herd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did dad get his Chinese cook?&#8221; questioned
Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;s got a Chink named Hop Lung; a
pretty good sort of a chap, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>They crossed two more hills and then passed
through a patch of tall timber. Here there was a
rough wagon road, and the foreman explained
that it was used for hauling firewood to the
ranch house and the bunkhouse.</p>
<p>It was growing dark when the party on horseback
approached the ranch. Already lights were
streaming from the windows and the automobile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
stood in front of the wide veranda which ran
around two sides of the building.</p>
<p>&#8220;They got here ahead of us,&#8221; announced Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought they would,&#8221; answered the foreman.
&#8220;The river road is in pretty good shape
just now, so I suppose the boss made fast time
in driving over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trail to the ranch was rougher than I expected,&#8221;
put in Andy. &#8220;If you tried to run a
horse over it he would most likely break a leg
and maybe you would break your neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known one of our boys to go over to the
station inside of twenty minutes,&#8221; returned the
foreman. &#8220;But he only did it to catch a train and
on a bet. I&#8217;d rather take my time and save my
horseflesh.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they reached the ranch Mrs. Powell came
out on the veranda to greet her son and his
chums. She was a round-faced, motherly woman,
and she immediately did all she could to make
the young folks feel at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be thoroughly tired out from your
long trip,&#8221; said she. &#8220;So we will have supper
right away, and then if any of you want to go to
bed you can do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m tired,&#8221; answered Jack.
&#8220;But I suppose the girls are and maybe Aunt
Grace is, too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>The travelers were shown to some rooms and
then told where they could wash up if they so
desired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supper will be ready in ten minutes,&#8221; announced
Mrs. Powell. &#8220;So don&#8217;t take too much
time in primping up,&#8221; she added, with a smile to
the girls. &#8220;Remember, you are on a ranch now
and you can dress exactly as you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to slip on a plain gingham right
now,&#8221; declared Martha.</p>
<p>Their hand baggage had been brought along
on the running-board of the touring car, and a
little later one of the cowboys came in with their
trunks, which had been brought over from the station
in a wagon. In the meanwhile the crowd sat
down to a somewhat elaborate supper which Hop
Lung had prepared under Mrs. Powell&#8217;s supervision.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a very good cook,&#8221; the lady of the ranch
confided to Mrs. Rover. &#8220;But he occasionally
tries to turn out some very funny concoctions,
so that I find it advisable to keep my eyes on
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The cowboys are quite excited over the idea
of having visitors here all summer,&#8221; said Songbird
Powell during the course of the meal. &#8220;And
two or three of them are especially excited over
the fact that there are going to be so many girls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
and ladies. You see, the brothers who used to
own these combined ranches weren&#8217;t married, and
all they had around the houses were an Indian
woman and a real old Dutch woman who was
almost entirely deaf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe Jackson told me that one of the cowboys,
a fellow named Hank Minno, was very bashful
and had almost been on the point of giving up
his job when he heard so many skirts were coming
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, I think I&#8217;d like to make the acquaintance
of Mr. Hank,&#8221; said Martha mischievously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps if he saw you coming he&#8217;d run away,&#8221;
returned Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I think he&#8217;ll get over his bashfulness, and
so will some of the others,&#8221; answered Songbird
Powell. &#8220;And let me tell you one thing&mdash;when
I first got here I thought the men were a pretty
rough crowd, but the more I get to know them,
the more I&#8217;m satisfied they&#8217;re all right at heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your foreman certainly seems to be a fine fellow,&#8221;
said Jack. &#8220;We got well acquainted with
him riding over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was well recommended by the former owners
of the ranch, Jack. And so far I&#8217;ve had no
occasion to find any fault with him. He seems
thoroughly trustworthy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>The Powells had given their visitors their choice
of what to do concerning rooms. They could
either crowd themselves a little and remain in the
one ranch house, or otherwise the boys could take
rooms in the other house, which was located about
two hundred yards away.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we went over to the other place we could
have things all our own way,&#8221; whispered Andy
to his brother and Fred. &#8220;We could come and go
to suit ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you boys had better stay in this house
with us,&#8221; said Mrs. Rover. &#8220;Then we can keep
an eye on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is no sense in all of us being
crowded,&#8221; returned Sam Rover. &#8220;And the boys
are certainly old enough to take care of themselves.
I think we had better let this matter rest
until to-morrow, and then we can see how we can
arrange it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the boys go over to the other ranch house
I&#8217;ll have Joe Jackson stay there with them,&#8221; said
Songbird. &#8220;He&#8217;ll know how to make them line
up if anything goes wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several days later it was arranged for all the
boys to take their belongings and settle down in
the other ranch house so far as rooming was concerned.
They were to have their meals in the
main house. The foreman of the ranch went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
with them, taking a room in a corner where he
could watch what was going on if it became necessary
to do so. The boys took three connecting
rooms, the twins occupying one, Jack and Fred
another, and Spouter and Gif the third.</p>
<p>On the second day at the ranch the boys began
to feel quite at home. Accompanied by the men,
they had visited many points of interest and had
become acquainted with all the cowboys, and also
with Hop Lung, the cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wellee nice boys,&#8221; remarked the cook, after
they had been chatting with him and gone their
way. &#8220;Wellee nice boys. Me cookee heap good
dinner for &#8217;em.&#8221; And then he dived into his
kitchen to start his preparations for the next
meal.</p>
<p>The boys found all the cowboys friendly. One
of them could do some marvelous stunts with a
lasso, and, urged by the foreman, gave an exhibition
which interested the lads exceedingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that fellow is as good as anybody on the
vaudeville stage,&#8221; remarked Fred. &#8220;I never
dreamed so much could be done with a rope. Just
see how he whirled it around his body and between
his legs and over his head!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and how he lassoed those three running
horses all in a bunch,&#8221; added Fred. &#8220;That&#8217;s what
got me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to be in a Wild West Show,&#8221; put in
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have the boys give you an exhibition of
shooting this evening,&#8221; said the foreman, and he
was as good as his word.</p>
<p>Some of the cowboys proved to be remarkable
shots both with the rifle and the pistol. But here
the boys, especially Fred and Jack, felt at home,
and they, too, showed what they could do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rattlesnakes and tarantulas!&#8221; exclaimed one
of the cowboys, Hank Minno, the fellow who was
supposed to be so bashful. &#8220;You kids sure kin
shoot some. I s&#8217;pose you learned it at that there
military school you&#8217;ve been goin&#8217; to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Fred. &#8220;Although we sometimes
do a little practicing when we&#8217;re at home.
Down in the long cellar of our house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a good thing to know how to shoot,
lad. Sometimes it comes in mighty handy like,&#8221;
answered Hank Minno.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>HOP LUNG AND THE FISH</h3>
</div>

<p>By the end of the first week all of the boys
felt thoroughly at home on Big Horn Ranch.
They had visited many points of interest, including
the cowboys&#8217; bunkhouse and also the big
range to the eastward, and they had likewise
tramped over a number of the hills and tried their
hand at fishing in the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is one dandy place,&#8221; remarked Jack
to the others one day when they were coming up
to the house from the river, each with a fair-sized
string of fish to his credit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly never had such fishing as this
in the East,&#8221; answered Gif, as he looked at his
string admiringly. &#8220;Just look at the size of &#8217;em,
will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what Hop Lung will say when he
sees them,&#8221; remarked Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a scheme!&#8221; cried Andy. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have
a little fun,&#8221; and thereupon he unfolded to the
others what he had in mind to do. They readily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
agreed to his suggestion, and all came up to the
ranch house by a roundabout way. Then Spouter
called out loudly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hop Lung! Hop Lung! Come out here a
minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment later the Chinese cook appeared, a
long soup ladle in on one hand and a carving
knife in the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;You callee me?&#8221; he queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Spouter. &#8220;I want you to
come around to the front of the house and tell
me what you know about this,&#8221; and he motioned
to the cook to follow him around to the big
veranda.</p>
<p>No sooner had their chum and the cook disappeared
than the others ran into the kitchen.
Here at one side was a home-made kitchen cabinet,
the top within a foot of the ceiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;See if you can find the big bread-board,&#8221; said
Randy. &#8220;I guess that will answer our purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And here is the fishing line,&#8221; added his twin.
&#8220;We can run it from the ceiling over to the window
and then outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>The line was run to the window as mentioned,
then fastened to the ceiling back of the cabinet,
and then to the back end of the board, which was
placed flat on the top of the cabinet. On the board
the boys placed the fish, laying them out in a row
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
from front to back. One fish was placed on the
pulled-out shelf of the lower part of the cabinet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, clear out before Hop Lung catches
us,&#8221; said Andy. And the lads lost no time in disappearing.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Spouter had taken the Chinese
cook to the front of the ranch house and
then to an out-of-the-way corner where there was
a large spider&#8217;s web.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, he&#8217;s gone now!&#8221; exclaimed Spouter, in
a tone of disappointment. &#8220;Do you see him anywhere,
Hop Lung?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hop Lung see what?&#8221; demanded the puzzled
cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that great big blue and gold spider with
white feet!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blue an&#8217; gol&#8217; spide?&#8221; queried Hop Lung. &#8220;See
black spide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I don&#8217;t mean the black spider. I mean
that great big blue and gold spider about that
long,&#8221; and Spouter showed up his two forefingers
six inches apart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Noee see spide so long dat,&#8221; answered the Chinese
cook, shaking his head doubtfully. &#8220;Sploutel
maybe see catpillal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t a caterpillar. It was a spider.
Although I think it might have had wings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um, wings! Spide he all the samee buttelfly,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
announced Hop Lung. &#8220;No see him,&#8221; and he got
down on his hands and knees to peer up into the
corner to make certain.</p>
<p>Spouter continued to engage his attention until
he heard the boys coming around the corner of
the house. Then he turned to them as if in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! I thought you fellows were off fishing,&#8221;
he remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we were,&#8221; answered Gif calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got a nice little fish, Hop Lung. I laid him
in the kitchen for you,&#8221; remarked Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You git only one flish?&#8221; queried the cook in
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe you can catch more,&#8221; put in
Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hop Lung no go flishee. Hop Lung cookee,&#8221;
was the calm reply. And then the cook walked
back to the rear of the ranch house.</p>
<p>Watching their chance, the boys stole back, some
to the window where was located the string which
had been attached to the board on the top of the
cabinet, and others to another window from which
they might see what would take place. Hop Lung
had gone inside and picked up the fish left on the
cabinet shelf. He looked it over, wiped off the
shelf carefully, and then took up the fish and
disappeared into the pantry with it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, Andy!&#8221; whispered his twin. And
thereupon Andy gave the string in his hand two
or three little jerks. From the board on the top
of the cabinet a fish fell down to the shelf below.</p>
<p>It had hardly fallen in place when Hop Lung
came from the pantry. He looked to see how matters
were going on the stove, and then turned
again to the cabinet.</p>
<p>A queer look came over his face when he saw
the fish lying in the same place that the first had
occupied. He looked toward the door to find no
one there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Him funny,&#8221; he murmured in his Pidgin-English.
&#8220;Him vellee funny.&#8221; Then he took up
the second fish and walked into the pantry with it.</p>
<p>No sooner had he done this than Andy, doing
his best to control his laughter, jiggled the string
again. This time, as luck would have it, two
fish came down, to light side by side on the cabinet
shelf.</p>
<p>Again Hop Lung entered the kitchen and again
he looked at what was cooking on the stove. He
stirred the mass in one of the pots carefully, and
then came back to his cabinet to get some seasoning.</p>
<p>When he saw the two fish lying there his eyes
nearly started out of his head. He jabbered
something in his native tongue and then looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
around wildly, first to one side of the kitchen and
then the other. Then he looked toward the door
leading to the dining room and then he came to
the door leading to the yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Duck!&#8221; was all Andy said, and he and the others
lost no time in getting out of sight.</p>
<p>Hop Lung looked carefully around the yard
and then came slowly back into the kitchen. He
walked again to the stove to see that nothing was
burning, and finally came back to the cabinet and
picked up the two fish gingerly. Meanwhile, the
boys tiptoed their way back to their original positions
at the windows.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll begin to think the cabinet is haunted,&#8221;
whispered Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Either that, or else he&#8217;ll think he&#8217;s bewitched,&#8221;
answered Gif.</p>
<p>And both were about right, for the poor Chinaman
looked all around the cabinet and even behind
and under it, and then he looked under the
table and the chairs. Finally, still bewildered,
he walked into the pantry with the fish, which he
carried before him at arm&#8217;s length, as if afraid it
might bite him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better give him a shower now, Andy,&#8221; whispered
his brother, and thereupon Andy gave the
string a strong pull which sent all the remaining
fish tumbling down on the cabinet and the floor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
The noise reached Hop Lung in the pantry, and
he came forth on a run.</p>
<p>When he saw the quantity of fish that had appeared
so miraculously he was nearly dumbfounded.
With eyes and mouth wide open and
hands up-raised he uttered a sudden yell of fright
and dove through the doorway leading to the dining
room and the living room beyond.</p>
<p>In the living room Mrs. Rover and Mrs. Powell
were sitting doing some sewing. The sudden appearance
of the Chinaman caused them to look
up in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter, Hop Lung?&#8221; demanded
Mrs. Powell, as she sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flishee! Flishee!&#8221; screamed the cook.
&#8220;Kitchen full flishee! Hop Lung no knowee
where flishee come! One flishee&mdash;two flishee&mdash;two
flishee more&mdash;whole blame kitchen flishee!&#8221;
spluttered the cook, his eyes rolling from one side
to the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious me! is the man crazy?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Rover, rising. &#8220;What does he mean by
&#8216;flishee?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flishee! Flishee!&#8221; repeated Hop Lung. &#8220;No
flishee&mdash;all flishee!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine what he&#8217;s driving at,&#8221; remarked
Mrs. Powell. &#8220;Where is the trouble, Hop
Lung? In the kitchen?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Les, Miz Plowell. Kitchen all flishee!&#8221;</p>
<p>Without ado the lady of the ranch marched
into the kitchen, followed by Mrs. Rover. All
the ladies could see were the freshly-caught fish
resting on the cabinet shelf and the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything the matter here except
that some of your fish are on the floor,&#8221; remarked
Mrs. Powell calmly. &#8220;You had better pick them
up and wash them off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the boys catch those fish?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Rover. &#8220;They said they were going fishing a
couple of hours ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys clatchee one flishee,&#8221; announced Hop
Lung. Then a sudden idea entered his head, and
he made a quick leap to the yard door. He was
just in time to see the boys trying to retreat, all
laughing merrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You foolee Hop Lung! You foolee Hop
Lung!&#8221; he shrieked wildly, and of a sudden came
back into the kitchen, scooped up several of the
fish, and ran outside again. Wildly he threw one
fish after another at the lads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hop Lung, stop that!&#8221; commanded Mrs.
Powell sternly. &#8220;Those fish are too good to throw
away!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bloys fool Hop Lung,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;One
flishee&mdash;two flishee&mdash;four flishee&mdash;all whole lot
flishee,&#8221; he continued, trying his best to explain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
And then by pantomime he showed how he had
found the first of the fish and placed them in the
pantry.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing more than some of their tricks,
Hop Lung,&#8221; said Mrs. Powell. &#8220;They had no
right to play such tricks, and I&#8217;ll call them to account
for it. But you had better pick up the fish
which you threw outside. They&#8217;re too good to be
thrown away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hop Lung flix bloys, play flishee tlick,&#8221; answered
the Celestial. And then a little later he
set about preparing supper.</p>
<p>The boys did not think it wise to return to the
house just then, and so wandered off to the stable
where the ranch horses were kept.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was certainly a rich joke,&#8221; remarked Fred,
with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet Hop Lung will have it in for us for
that,&#8221; returned Randy.</p>
<p>And Hop Lung did have it in for them, as they
were to learn in the near future.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>A HORSE AND A SNAKE</h3>
</div>

<p>During the days which followed at Big Horn
Ranch the Rover boys and their chums asked Joe
Jackson if he knew Bud Haddon and the other
men who had been with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know Haddon,&#8221; answered the foreman
of the ranch. &#8220;He used to work for Bimbel
on a ranch on the other side of the river; but I
think he left there several months ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if he did, I rather think he&#8217;s going
back,&#8221; answered Jack. &#8220;Can you tell us anything
about him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I imagine he&#8217;s as good as the average fellow
around Bimbel&#8217;s place,&#8221; answered Joe Jackson.
&#8220;You see, none of our crowd have much to
do with that outfit. Bimbel is a hard fellow to
get along with, and some of the men working for
his outfit have rather shady characters.&#8221; The
foreman looked at the boys curiously. &#8220;How do
you happen to know the fellow?&#8221;</p>
<p>The lads had come to like the foreman very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
much and felt that they could trust him
thoroughly, so they told their story in detail, to
which Jackson listened with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me as if Haddon was trying to blackmail
that kid Bangs,&#8221; was his comment. &#8220;That
is unless there was something in the talk about
that barn being burned with the horses. It&#8217;s just
possible that fellow Bangs had something to do
with it and Haddon was making him pay for
keeping his mouth shut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know anybody by the name of John
Calder whose barn burned down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. That couldn&#8217;t have been anywhere around
here or I certainly would have heard about it.
But there&#8217;s one thing I do know,&#8221; added the foreman
suddenly. &#8220;There&#8217;s a man named Jarley
Bangs who owns a ranch on the other side of the
river&mdash;a small place next to the one run by Bimbel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jarley Bangs!&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;Do you suppose
it could be Brassy Bangs&#8217; father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; answered Gif. &#8220;I believe
Bangs&#8217; folks live in Wyoming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this Bangs may be some relative of his,&#8221;
put in Spouter.</p>
<p>The matter was talked over a while longer, but
the boys could learn little further from the foreman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Joe Jackson at
last. &#8220;I&#8217;ll put it up to some of the cowboys.
They may know more about Bimbel and his outfit
and about Jarley Bangs than I do. Bangs has
a reputation for being a very queer and miserly
man, but that&#8217;s about all I can say of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys, and even the girls, spent quite a little
of their time in the saddle. Both Mary and
Martha had learned to ride while at home, using
the bridle path in Central Park, so they felt at
home when galloping over the plains.</p>
<p>&#8220;This outing is going to do Mary a world of
good,&#8221; confided Mrs. Rover to Mrs. Powell. &#8220;She
has always been so timid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The river in which the boys went fishing and
also bathing was a broad, shallow stream which
could be forded in many places with ease. So
far, however, the lads had remained on their side
of the watercourse. But one day Jack proposed
that they go off on horseback and do a little exploring
on the other side.</p>
<p>&#8220;We might ride past the Bimbel place, and also
the one Jarley Bangs owns,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Who
knows but what we may catch sight of Bud Haddon
and his crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to get into any trouble with
those fellows,&#8221; put in Fred quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they can&#8217;t touch us!&#8221; exclaimed Andy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
&#8220;They don&#8217;t even know us. And we&#8217;ve as much
right to use the trails around here as anybody&mdash;the
land isn&#8217;t fenced in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but you know what Jackson said,&#8221; went
on Fred. &#8220;He said the Bimbel outfit wasn&#8217;t a
very nice one and that Bangs was very miserly
and peculiar. That sounds as if both places were
good ones to steer clear of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come on! Let&#8217;s go anyhow,&#8221; put in
Spouter. &#8220;I&#8217;m anxious to know what sort of
neighbors we have. They can&#8217;t find any fault
with us for coming over when they find out that
my father owns this ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys talked this matter over several times,
and the next day obtained permission to take the
horses and go off for a day&#8217;s outing along the
river. They were to take their lunch with them,
and did not expect to come back until evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we could go along,&#8221; sighed Martha.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take you along next time, Martha,&#8221; answered
her brother. &#8220;This time I&#8217;m afraid the
ride will be a little too long for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Martha and I will take a little
ride of our own,&#8221; declared Mary. &#8220;We can go
up to the edge of the woods and pick some wild
flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do it!&#8221; answered her cousin quickly.
&#8220;One of the cowboys tells me there are all sorts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
of wild flowers up there near one of the springs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hop Lung was told to prepare a lunch which
the boys might take along with them, and set to
work immediately. As he got the things ready
the Celestial had a faraway look in his eyes and
once or twice he stuck out his tongue suggestively.</p>
<p>&#8220;One flishee&mdash;two flishee&mdash;lot flishee,&#8221; he murmured
to himself. &#8220;Hop Lung fixee boys,&#8221; and
he smiled in his own peculiar way.</p>
<p>The day dawned bright and clear, and immediately
after breakfast the boys leaped into the saddle
and with good-natured shouts swung the
sombreros they were wearing, and started off on
their ride. Each had equipped himself with a
pistol, although they expected to do no shooting,
and several carried small saddlebags containing
their food and drink, the latter placed in a couple
of thermos bottles. They also carried feed for
the horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoop-la!&#8221; shouted Andy gaily. &#8220;Come on,
fellows! let&#8217;s put distance between ourselves and
the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better take it a little easy at the start, Andy,&#8221;
remonstrated Gif. &#8220;Remember we expect to cover
quite a few miles, and we don&#8217;t want to wear out
the horses at the start.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let Spouter set the pace,&#8221; announced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
Jack, for he had not forgotten that they were all
guests of the lad mentioned.</p>
<p>They had questioned the foreman regarding
the lay of the land, and he had drawn up a rough
map for them which Jack carried. Inside of half
an hour they reached the fording place he had
mentioned, and there crossed the stream, coming
out on the side of a small hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if we&#8217;ll come across any wild animals,&#8221;
remarked Fred, as they pushed along a
well-defined trail leading to the top of the hill
and through a small patch of scrub timber further
westward.</p>
<p>&#8220;From what Joe Jackson said, I don&#8217;t think
there&#8217;s very much left in this immediate vicinity,&#8221;
answered Spouter. &#8220;You see, the cowboys have
scared most of the animals away. Of course,
they occasionally come across a bobcat or a mountain
lion, and then we might come across a wolf
or a fox or some jackrabbits, or even a bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, please don&#8217;t let &#8217;em come at us in a
bunch!&#8221; cried Randy, with a grin. &#8220;One at a
time, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be our luck not to see a thing worth shooting,&#8221;
declared Fred. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t give five cents
for our chances of bringing down anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred had scarcely spoken when the horse Gif
was riding shied suddenly to one side, throwing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
Gif into some low bushes. Then the horse gave
a snort and leaped ahead on the trail, not stopping
until he had covered a hundred yards or more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! what&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; exclaimed Jack,
bringing his own steed to a halt. &#8220;Are you hurt,
Gif?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m all right. But what startled that
horse?&#8221; demanded the other lad, as he scrambled
to his feet. Then he gave a sudden yell. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
snake! Look out!&#8221;</p>
<p>All looked in the direction pointed out by Gif,
and there saw a black object wriggling away
through the brushwood. As quickly as they could
Jack and Spouter, who were close by, pulled out
their pistols and fired at the snake. They saw the
reptile rise up in the air, turning and twisting, and
then disappear from sight between the rocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up? What are you shooting at?&#8221;
cried Fred, galloping to the spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;A snake. He scared Gif&#8217;s horse and threw
Gif into the bushes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he got away, although I think we
wounded him,&#8221; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny how that horse shied,&#8221; said Spouter.
&#8220;Maybe he stepped right on the snake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That might be,&#8221; put in Fred. &#8220;Maybe the
snake was sunning himself and didn&#8217;t notice our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
approach until the horse stepped on him. Then he
switched around, and that must have started the
horse off. I wonder if we can catch him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; answered Spouter. &#8220;Gosh! I&#8217;m
glad no one was bit. That snake looked to be of
pretty good size.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Spouter and Jack hurried forward to
capture the runaway horse, Gif was assisted to
the back of the steed Randy rode.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t go out on my head on the
rocks,&#8221; remarked Gif, as the boys went forward.
&#8220;I might have broken my neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you picked out just the right place to
fall into,&#8221; answered Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t pick it out. I went where I was sent,&#8221;
returned the other lad calmly. &#8220;After this I&#8217;m
going to keep my eyes peeled for more snakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we had better all do that,&#8221; said Fred.
&#8220;Gee! I&#8217;d forgotten all about those pests.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they reached the runaway horse they
found him still somewhat skittish. But he was
soon calmed down, and then Gif remounted him,
and they set off along the trail as before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we didn&#8217;t exactly meet a wild animal,&#8221;
remarked Randy. &#8220;But we met something just as
bad.&#8221;</p>
<p> Presently the boys came to a spot where the
river wound around the hill, and beyond this was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
a broad stretch of plains, apparently many miles
in extent. Far to the southward they could see
some tall timber.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bimbel ranch must be somewhere in this
vicinity,&#8221; declared Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and the Bangs place can&#8217;t be so very far
off,&#8221; returned Fred.</p>
<p>But distances in the open air are deceiving, and
the boys rode along over the plains for the best
part of an hour before they reached a spot where
the trail branched in several directions. Here
they came to a halt, wondering which way to turn
next.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad they don&#8217;t put up a few signboards
out here,&#8221; grumbled Randy. &#8220;How is a
fellow going to know where he&#8217;s heading?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose the natives know these trails just
like we know the main streets of New York
City,&#8221; answered Jack. &#8220;And that being so, they
don&#8217;t need any signboards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack had consulted the rude map given to him
by the ranch foreman, but this did not seem to
have upon it the forks of the trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose those cowboys would know at once
which was the main trail and which were only
side trails,&#8221; said Gif.</p>
<p>The boys were still uncertain which way to
turn when Fred set up a cry of amazement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes an auto, boys! What do you
know about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An auto!&#8221; several of them repeated.
&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>The youngest Rover pointed with his finger,
and there, to the astonishment of every one in
the party, they beheld a small touring car coming
across the plains at a speed of twelve or fifteen
miles an hour. It was running in a curiously
haphazard fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a way to run an automobile!&#8221; ejaculated
Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the driver is getting out of the way of
holes,&#8221; answered Jack. And then he added
quickly: &#8220;There isn&#8217;t any driver!&#8221;</p>
<p>Completely mystified, the boys stared at the oncoming
automobile. For a moment it seemed
heading directly for them, but suddenly swerved
and started off across the plains in another direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is empty!&#8221; ejaculated Andy. &#8220;It&#8217;s running
by itself!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>JARLEY BANGS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who ever heard of an automobile running
around by itself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gotten away from somebody,&#8221; came from
Jack. &#8220;Just look at it skating over the ground!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on! Let&#8217;s stop the blamed thing!&#8221;
shouted Andy, and started off on horseback after
the runaway car.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have a sweet job catching that auto,&#8221;
declared his twin. Nevertheless, he followed
Andy, and, not knowing what else to do, the others
did the same.</p>
<p>The automobile was of a cheap variety, and
clattered noisily on its way, with one cylinder occasionally
missing fire. It had been running in
a snakelike course, but now it seemed to be making
something of a circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;By jinks! I think it&#8217;s coming back here!&#8221;
exclaimed Fred suddenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t running as fast as it was,&#8221; declared
Spouter. &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s going to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to see if I can&#8217;t get aboard!&#8221; cried
Jack, with sudden determination, and headed his
horse behind the touring car, which was still moving
at a fair rate of speed.</p>
<p>Once one of the front wheels went down in a
hole, and then the car slued around and started
off, heading almost for the boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of the way there or you&#8217;ll be run
down!&#8221;</p>
<p>Wild cries rent the air, and the young horsemen
scattered in every direction. But Jack was
watching his chance, and as the car slued around
once more he managed to leap from his horse and
clutch the side of the automobile. Then he leaped
into the car and turned off the power, and in a
few seconds he brought the automobile to a standstill.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the queerest adventure I ever heard
of,&#8221; declared Gif, when the brief excitement had
come to an end. &#8220;Who ever heard of meeting a
runaway auto like this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we can be thankful that we weren&#8217;t
run down,&#8221; returned Fred. &#8220;You took a big
chance, Jack, in jumping on board as you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it wasn&#8217;t such a risk,&#8221; answered his cousin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
modestly. &#8220;I think the auto was getting ready to
stop anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder where the owner is?&#8221; questioned
Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the auto struck a stone and threw him
out!&#8221; exclaimed Spouter suddenly. &#8220;He may be
lying along the trail somewhere stunned or dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess the best thing we can do is to see if
we can locate the owner,&#8221; declared Gif, after a
pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Spouter. You get in the auto with
me and we&#8217;ll run it back in the direction it came
from,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;The other fellows can follow
and bring our horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you can run this car?&#8221; questioned
Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I can! It isn&#8217;t much different from the
cars I&#8217;m used to even though it&#8217;s a cheap one,&#8221;
was the reply.</p>
<p>Spouter dismounted and was soon beside Jack.
The power was again turned on and the car moved
on with many a little jerk and jangling of metal-ware.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s next door to a bit of junk,&#8221; remarked
Jack, as they moved forward along the trail at
a rate of about fifteen miles an hour. &#8220;I think
if a fellow tried to make real speed with it it
would fall to pieces.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds to me as if it needed oiling,&#8221; ventured
Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it needs oiling, and new springs, and a
new engine, and a new chassis and a few other
things, and then it would be quite a good car,&#8221;
answered Jack, with a grin.</p>
<p>The two lads in the car had covered less than
a mile, and the others were coming up behind
them, when they saw a man running toward
them and waving his arms wildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi there! Stop!&#8221; called out the man. &#8220;Stop,
I tell you! If you don&#8217;t stop I&#8217;ll have the law
on you!&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as he saw the man Jack slowed up
and came to a standstill by the side of the fellow.
He was a tall, lean man of about fifty, with a
strangely wrinkled and sallow face and long,
drooping, reddish mustache. He had a pair of
greenish-brown eyes that seemed to bore the boys
through and through as he gazed rather savagely
at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by running off with my
car?&#8221; he demanded, as he shook his fist at the
lads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this your car?&#8221; questioned Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know well enough it&#8217;s my car!&#8221; blustered
the man. &#8220;And I demand to know what
you mean by running away with it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t run away with it,&#8221; answered
Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you did!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We did not!&#8221; put in Jack. &#8220;We found it back
there on the plains running around all by itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? You expect me to believe such a
story as that?&#8221; exclaimed the tall man, glaring
at them more ferociously than ever. &#8220;Running
around by itself! How could it be doing that?
You took it from where I left it, up by the trees
yonder!&#8221; and he pointed to a quantity of tall timber
some distance away.</p>
<p>By this time the other boys were coming up,
bringing with them the two unused horses. The
man gazed at them in surprise and also noted the
two steeds that were not being used.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re telling the truth and maybe you
ain&#8217;t,&#8221; went on the man sourly. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to git
at the bottom of this.&#8221; Thereupon the boys related
what had taken place and Spouter mentioned
the fact that his father was the owner of
Big Horn Ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then you&#8217;re Mr. Powell&#8217;s son, eh?&#8221; cried
the man. &#8220;Are you the boy who went to Colby
Hall with my nephew, Lester Bangs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Lester your nephew?&#8221; queried Spouter.
And as the man nodded shortly, he added: &#8220;Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
you must be Mr. Jarley Bangs?&#8221; and again the
man nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you ought to thank our chum here,
Jack Rover, for bringing your car back to you,
Mr. Bangs,&#8221; remarked Gif. &#8220;If he hadn&#8217;t jumped
from his horse into the car the machine might be
racking itself to pieces out on the prairie now.
It was doing all sorts of stunts when he jumped
aboard and shut off the power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand this nohow,&#8221; grumbled
Jarley Bangs. &#8220;If what you say is true, how in
thunder did that car git started? I left it by the
edge of the woods while I went in to look over
some timber that we thought of gitting out this
fall. All at once I heard the engine go off with
a bang, and when I ran out of the woods to see
what was doing the car was gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was any one with you?&#8221; questioned Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I came out alone. Lester wanted to
come along, but I told him to stay at the ranch
and do some work. He seems to think that all
he&#8217;s out here for is to play.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then Lester is staying with you, is he?&#8221;
queried Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. His folks let him come up for a couple
of months. Then he&#8217;s going back to his home in
Wyoming, and after that he&#8217;s got to return to that
military school. I think it&#8217;s a fool notion to send
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
him to that school. If I was his father I&#8217;d make
him stay out here and go to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose Lester tried to start the
car, do you?&#8221; questioned Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could he if he was at the ranch? But
wait a minute! He said something about going
fishing in that brook that flows through the woods.
Maybe he did come up that way, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he know how to run the auto?&#8221; asked
Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he does. But I don&#8217;t let him run it very
often because he&#8217;s so careless I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;ll
ruin the machine&mdash;he bangs her over the rocks
something awful. I ain&#8217;t got no money to waste
on a new car. This has got to do, even if it is
kind of used up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Brassy&mdash;I mean Lester&mdash;came up and
tried to start the car while the gears were in
mesh,&#8221; suggested Jack; &#8220;and then when the car
started to run away perhaps he got scared and
ran away, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he did anything like that he&#8217;ll have an account
to settle with me!&#8221; exclaimed Jarley Bangs,
his eyes glowing with anger. &#8220;That boy is getting
too fresh. I said he could come up here,
thinking he&#8217;d do some work around the place
and so earn the money that I promised him for
his schooling. But evidently he thinks more of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
having a good time than he does of working.
He is forever fooling around the car and wanting
to run it; so I wouldn&#8217;t put it past him to do
what you suspect. As soon as I git home I&#8217;ll
ketch him and make him tell me the truth,&#8221; continued
Jarley Bangs, with a determined shake
of his head.</p>
<p>After that he questioned Spouter concerning
the ranch Mr. Powell had purchased and spoke
of the men who had previously owned the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;These city fellows think they kin come out
here and make a fortune on a ranch,&#8221; he growled.
&#8220;But after they&#8217;ve owned a place a year or two
they find it ain&#8217;t so easy. A man has got to hustle
like all git-out to make a living.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your ranch located?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our buildings are right behind that patch of
timber,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;It&#8217;s not so very much
of a place, but it&#8217;s good enough for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where is the Bimbel ranch?&#8221; questioned
Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s up to the northward, over the top of
yonder hill. But you young fellows had better
give Bimbel a wide berth,&#8221; went on Jarley Bangs,
with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t like no strangers hanging around,
that&#8217;s why. If a stranger comes up to his door
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
Bimbel always reaches for his gun. He had
trouble years ago with some tramps, and he never
got over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that Jarley Bangs had but little more to
say. The boys had left the touring car, and now
the man jumped inside, saw to it that everything
was in order, and then asked Spouter to crank
up for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t no use to waste time here,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to git back to what I was doing. I&#8217;ll
tell Lester I saw you, and if he wants to he kin
come over to Big Horn Ranch and visit&mdash;he
ain&#8217;t of much account around my place. And I&#8217;ll
git at the bottom of what happened to this auto,
too, even if I have to lick it out of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Lester will care to visit our
ranch,&#8221; answered Spouter coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I ain&#8217;t got nothing to say about that one
way or the other. Now I&#8217;m off,&#8221; and with a short
nod of his head Jarley Bangs threw in the gears
of his machine and rattled away, slowly gathering
speed as he proceeded.</p>
<p>&#8220;A kind, considerate man, not!&#8221; exclaimed
Andy in disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;How politely he thanked Jack for returning
his car,&#8221; added Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the beautiful invitation we got to visit
his place,&#8221; put in Randy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if Brassy really started that car on
him?&#8221; questioned Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be,&#8221; answered Gif. And then he
added: &#8220;Gee, I&#8217;m sorry for Brassy if he has to
live with such an uncle as that! Wouldn&#8217;t you
think he&#8217;d rather stay at home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s a case of money,&#8221; put in Randy.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear what Mr. Bangs said about
paying for tuition at Colby Hall? Brassy&#8217;s folks
may be quite poor, and they may be depending
on this uncle for financial aid.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>A NEW ARRIVAL</h3>
</div>

<p>After the disappearance of Jarley Bangs the
Rover boys and their chums continued their trip
on horseback.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s move over the hill in the direction of
the Bimbel ranch,&#8221; suggested Spouter. &#8220;I&#8217;d like
to get a bird&#8217;s-eye view of that outfit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we had better not go too close,&#8221; advised
Fred. &#8220;Bimbel may be getting out a shotgun
for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it isn&#8217;t as bad as all that, Fred. Those
things might have happened years ago when the
country was more sparsely settled and when there
were more bad men around. I don&#8217;t take much
stock in what Bangs said. Probably he and Bimbel
have quarreled. He struck me as being a man
who could get into a dispute very easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I was only fooling,&#8221; answered Fred. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t be afraid to ride right up to his door.
That is, in the daytime. Of course, if we did it
at night he might become suspicious.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, do you fellows know that it&#8217;s five minutes
to twelve?&#8221; questioned Andy, after consulting
his watch. &#8220;I move that we keep our eyes
open for some place where we can take it easy
and have lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I second the commotion,&#8221; returned his
brother, joking in a way their father had made
familiar to them.</p>
<p>The boys rode on for half an hour longer, and
then reached the top of the hill they were ascending.
Here they could look a long distance in all
directions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some view, I&#8217;ll say,&#8221; declared Jack, as he surveyed
the panorama. &#8220;What a picture for an
artist to paint!&#8221; and he pointed to the majestic
mountains to the westward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just look at the river&mdash;how it glistens and
sparkles in the sunshine,&#8221; burst out Spouter.
&#8220;See how it winds in and out like a silvery ribbon
among the hills and brushwood and then comes
out to cut the broad and fertile prairie in the far
distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spouter, you&#8217;ll have to write an essay about
this when you get back to the Hall,&#8221; said Fred,
with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, don&#8217;t mention school at a time like this!&#8221;
burst out Andy. &#8220;I want to forget all about
studying until it&#8217;s absolutely necessary to go back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
to it. And don&#8217;t forget it&#8217;s high time to eat,&#8221;
he added.</p>
<p>They moved along slowly and presently selected
a spot for their temporary camp. This was a short
distance from the trail they had been following.
It was at the edge of a patch of timber where
they were sheltered from the rays of the sun
which were now quite warm.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be in the shade here, and yet just see
the view we&#8217;ll have,&#8221; cried Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suits me,&#8221; announced Spouter promptly; and
the others agreed that the spot was a first-rate location.</p>
<p>It did not take the six chums long to give the
horses their feed and then to empty the saddlebags
and prepare their mid-day meal. They had
brought along chicken as well as roast-beef sandwiches,
hard boiled eggs, pickles, and a large cake,
and also a bag of doughnuts which Hop Lung
had learned to make from Mrs. Powell and of
which the Celestial was justly proud. They also
had with them a thermos bottle of hot cocoa and
another of coffee, all fixed ready to drink.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Hop Lung certainly spread himself for
us,&#8221; said Jack, as he took up one of the fat chicken
sandwiches and surveyed it with satisfaction.
Then he turned to the twins. &#8220;What are you grinning
about?&#8221; he questioned quickly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I was only thinking about the trick we
played on the Chink,&#8221; chuckled Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I was thinking of the same thing,&#8221; put
in his twin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder he didn&#8217;t try to get square with
us for that,&#8221; came from Fred. &#8220;An American
would be sure to try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The long ride in the open air had made all of
the boys hungry, and it was not long before they
had disposed of a large part of the sandwiches,
pickles and eggs, washing the meal down with
cocoa and coffee and also with water from a regular
water bottle Spouter carried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I guess it&#8217;s about time we passed around
some of the cake,&#8221; remarked Jack, presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll start on a doughnut,&#8221; answered
Gif.</p>
<p>The cake was in a square tin and had been cut
ready for use. In a few seconds all of the boys
were munching away lustily.</p>
<p>And then something happened! It was Fred
who was the first to notice that the piece of cake
he was devouring had a peculiar puckery taste.
He rolled some of the cake around in his mouth,
and then suddenly ejected it, and just as he did
this Andy dropped the doughnut he was devouring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my! What&#8217;s the matter with that cake?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, this doughnut tastes like fire!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, my mouth is burning up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me some of that water, quick! My
tongue is getting blistered!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose is in this cake, anyhow,
and in the doughnuts?&#8221; demanded Jack, as
he, too, made a wry face and stopped eating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious me! do you suppose Hop Lung put
the wrong stuff in the cake and in the doughnuts?&#8221;
demanded Spouter anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this is awful!&#8221; groaned Gif. &#8220;I&#8217;m burning
up inside!&#8221; And he put both hands on his
stomach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;re poisoned!&#8221; suggested Randy.
He made a wild dive for the water bottle, and
this was passed around from hand to hand, each
lad drinking eagerly in an endeavor to wash the
burning taste from his mouth and throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what&#8217;s the matter,&#8221; said Jack, after
the most of the excitement was over. &#8220;Hop Lung
doctored the cake and the doughnuts to get square
with us for the trick we played on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if that&#8217;s so?&#8221; questioned Andy
soberly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s so!&#8221; broke in Gif. &#8220;That Chink
wasn&#8217;t as slow as you thought, Andy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, my mouth burns yet!&#8221; grumbled Randy,
taking a drink of cocoa. &#8220;That&#8217;s the worst dose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
I ever chewed. What do you suppose he put in
the cake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tasted to me like a combination of cayenne
pepper, mustard, and a few things like that,&#8221; answered
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the whole cake and all the doughnuts
must be no good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad! And I had my heart set on a
nice doughnut,&#8221; answered Spouter. &#8220;Just the
same, I can&#8217;t blame Hop Lung.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, let&#8217;s be thankful the sandwiches
are all right and so are the eggs,&#8221; remarked Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe some of the sandwiches that are left
are doctored,&#8221; put in Andy suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they look all right,&#8221; announced Gif, after
an inspection. &#8220;And he couldn&#8217;t do much with
the eggs while they were in their shells,&#8221; he
added.</p>
<p>While he was speaking, and while some of the
boys were still taking drinks of various kinds to
clear their mouths and throats of that awful
burning taste, Spouter made an inspection of the
paper bag containing the doughnuts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! here&#8217;s another little bag at the bottom
of the big one,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see what it
contains.&#8221;</p>
<p>He dumped out the doughnuts and drew forth
the smaller bag. Opening this, the lads found it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
contained six pieces of golden yellow pound cake,
neatly wrapped in tissue paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! is that more of the doctored stuff?&#8221; questioned
Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe. But I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; answered
Spouter. &#8220;I think Hop Lung put this in for a
peace offering, to be found after we had chewed
on that other stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in that surmise Spouter proved correct.
The pound cake was delicious, and, having sampled
it with caution to find that it was all right,
the boys ate it to the last crumb with great satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better dump all that other stuff away,&#8221;
said Fred. &#8220;No use of carrying it if it isn&#8217;t fit
to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe some of it is good,&#8221; returned Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to sample it and make sure?&#8221;
questioned Jack, with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your life! I wouldn&#8217;t want that burning
taste in my mouth again for a hundred dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys threw the highly-seasoned cake and
the doughnuts away, repacked what was left of
the other food, and then continued on their ride.
The trail led through the patch of timber and then
over some rather rough rocks and through some
brushwood. Among the rocks they found a spring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
where the water was clear and cold, and here
they had a most refreshing drink and watered
their horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s queer this spring is away up here on the
top of the hill,&#8221; remarked Spouter. &#8220;That water
must flow underground from the mountains yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a lot of underground streams there
must be!&#8221; returned Fred.</p>
<p>While moving along those in the lead had kept
their eyes open for more snakes. But no reptiles
appeared, for which they were thankful.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m sorry we didn&#8217;t see some sort of
wild animals,&#8221; said Randy, in speaking of this.
&#8220;I thought sure we&#8217;d see a bear or a deer or
something like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even birds seemed to be scarce in that vicinity,
and the only sound that broke the stillness as they
advanced was their own voices and the clatter
of the horses&#8217; hoofs on the rocks.</p>
<p>The trail was a well-defined one, and they
could see that it had been used only a short while
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Half a dozen horsemen have been this way
within the last few hours,&#8221; declared Gif. &#8220;Most
likely they were on their way to Bimbel&#8217;s ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if that man Haddon has gotten
here yet,&#8221; said Jack.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>&#8220;More than likely,&#8221; answered Fred. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll
remember, those men didn&#8217;t expect to stay in Arrow
Junction very long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know more about that chap, and
know exactly how he&#8217;s mixed up with Brassy
Bangs,&#8221; went on the oldest of the Rover boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;d all like to know that,&#8221; put in
Randy.</p>
<p>Presently they came to a turn of the trail.
Here they could see across a wide stretch of
prairie to where there was a collection of low
buildings, seven or eight in number. To the rear
of the buildings was a corral for horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look much different from lots of
other ranches,&#8221; said Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to go any closer to it?&#8221; questioned
Gif.</p>
<p>The boys talked the matter over, and while
Andy and Randy were rather curious to get a
more intimate view of the place, the others decided
that they would not ride any closer on this
trip.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s now nearly two o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said Spouter.
&#8220;And if we want to go any distance up the river
it will take us until sundown to get back home.&#8221;</p>
<p>They turned back, and an hour or so later
reached the point where they had parted from
Jarley Bangs. Then they took a trail up the river
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
and followed this until the sun, sinking over the
western mountains, warned them that it was time
for them to head for home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I&#8217;ve got an idea,&#8221; announced Andy, when
they came in sight of the ranch house. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
let on to anybody about that doctored cake. If
Hop Lung or anybody else mentions it, just act
as if nothing unusual had happened. Say the
lunch was as good as any we ever had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the idea!&#8221; returned his twin. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
keep that Chink guessing.&#8221; And it may be added
here that the boys kept their word, and Hop Lung
never knew how his little joke had terminated,
although he felt sure in his own mind that they
had received the full benefit of the trick he had
played.</p>
<p>The six boys were still some distance from the
house when they saw a man come out on the
veranda and wave his hand to them. At first
they thought it might be Sam Rover. But then,
of a sudden, Jack let out a yell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys, what do you know about this! Do you
recognize that man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Hans Mueller!&#8221; ejaculated Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Hans!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who would have thought he was coming to
the ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hans Mueller!&#8221; murmured Andy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
glad to see him. He&#8217;s as full of fun as a stray
dog is of fleas!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hans Mueller was a man who in his boyhood
days had been a boon companion of the Rover
boys&#8217; fathers. When he had gone to Putnam
Hall with the Rovers he had spoken very broken
English, and his improvement in speech had been
slow and painful. But Hans had prospered in a
business way, and was now the sole proprietor of
a chain of delicatessen stores in Chicago. He
was unmarried, and, having no family of his
own, had insisted upon it that all of his young
friends call him &#8220;uncle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello der, eferypody!&#8221; called out Hans Mueller
cordially, as he came down from the veranda
to greet them, his fat face beaming genially.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, Uncle Hans?&#8221; cried Jack, leaping
to the ground and shaking hands. &#8220;This is
certainly a surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Songpird tol&#8217; me you wouldn&#8217;t know I
vas coming,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;How you been
alreatty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine as silk,&#8221; answered Andy gayly. And
now all the boys clustered around to shake hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just the man we want here to help us
enjoy our vacation,&#8221; put in Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dot&#8217;s nice, Fred. I tink I vas going to haf
a fine time alreatty. And I need him,&#8221; went on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
Hans Mueller. &#8220;Since I come from de war back
from Europe, where I fights for Uncle Sam, I
work like a steam horse in mine delicatessen
stores. But so soon like Songpird says come out
here and meet dem Rovers and you udder friends,
I say to my clerks, &#8216;you got to run dem stores by
yourselfes alreatty yet awhile. I go oud to Pig
Horn Ranch and git some fresh air mine lungs
in.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get the fresh air all right enough,&#8221; announced
Spouter. &#8220;And we&#8217;re mighty glad you&#8217;re
here,&#8221; he added, and then led the way into the
house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>PROFESSOR DUKE&#8217;S SECRET</h3>
</div>

<p>The girls had already returned from the woods
and met Uncle Hans, as they called him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got somet&#8217;ing by mine trunk in for you
young ladies,&#8221; said Hans Mueller, with a broad
smile. And later on when his trunk arrived he
presented each of them with a bottle of the highest
grade of olives. He also had some olives for
Mrs. Powell, for use on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;I import dem olives myself alreatty yet,&#8221; he
vouchsafed. &#8220;Nopody by Chicago has olives half
so goot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d be surprised to see Uncle Hans
here,&#8221; declared Songbird Powell. &#8220;And I knew
an outing on the ranch would do him a world of
good. He has been confining himself too closely
to business since he got back from the war.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was grand of you, Uncle Hans, to fight for
Uncle Sam,&#8221; declared Martha.</p>
<p>&#8220;And vhy, I like to know?&#8221; demanded Hans
Mueller. &#8220;Since I come by der United States
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
over I been just such a goot American like anypody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to talk, Uncle Hans!&#8221; cried
Jack, and slapped him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>The next day the young folks took great pleasure
in showing Hans Mueller around the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;He vas chust like a farm, only different,&#8221;
remarked the delicatessen man. &#8220;Dot iss a nice
lot of cows you got, Songpird. I dink dos cows
vould make apout a million pounds of frankfurters,
not?&#8221; and at this remark there was a general
laugh.</p>
<p>A few days later Jack noticed that Songbird
Powell seemed to be worried over something.
The owner of Big Horn Ranch held an earnest
consultation with Joe Jackson, and then the foreman
of the ranch rode off in hot haste, accompanied
by two of his cowboys.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter&mdash;is something wrong?&#8221;
questioned Jack of Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four of our best horses are missing,&#8221; answered
Spouter. &#8220;The men are not sure whether
they strayed away or have been stolen. Jackson
and the fellows with him are going to ride along
the river and see if they can find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say something about other horses
being stolen before we got here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But they didn&#8217;t belong to my father.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
They belonged to the men who formerly owned
this ranch. They left them here, but at their own
risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were the animals now missing the horses
we rode?&#8221; questioned Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. They were the mounts used by Jackson
and his men. That is, three of the horses were.
The other was that beautiful black my father occasionally
rode.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Blackbird?&#8221; exclaimed Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I think Blackbird is the finest horse on
the ranch,&#8221; declared Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly is a splendid nag,&#8221; answered
Spouter. &#8220;And my dad thinks a great deal of
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The horse in question was a three-year-old,
shining black in color, with a peculiar diamond-shaped
spot of white on his forehead and a similar
spot on his chest. Because of these spots
some of the cowboys often referred to him as
Two-spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose those horses are worth some
money,&#8221; remarked Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed they are!&#8221; declared Spouter. &#8220;I heard
my father say he wouldn&#8217;t take four hundred dollars
for Blackbird. And the other animals must
be worth at least a hundred and fifty dollars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
apiece. You know they always had pretty good
horses on this ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly hope they get some trace of the
horses,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>But this hope was not fulfilled. Jackson and
those with him came back disappointed, saying
that they had found no trace of the animals.</p>
<p>About a week later came another surprise. The
young folks, including the girls, had gone off to
the woods for the best part of the day, and when
they returned, much to their astonishment, they
saw seated in rocking chairs on the veranda Ruth
and May.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness!&#8221; screamed Mary. &#8220;Ruth and
May! Glory hallelujah! How in the world did
you get here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you never let us know!&#8221; wailed Martha,
as she bounced up the steps to embrace her school
chums.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got started sooner than we expected,&#8221; answered
May.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you come alone?&#8221; questioned Jack, as
he, too, came forward, his pleasure showing on
his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we didn&#8217;t come alone,&#8221; answered Ruth.
&#8220;We came with Mr. and Mrs. Rover. They are
inside with the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother and dad!&#8221; burst out Andy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
&#8220;Where are they?&#8221; And he raced into the house,
followed by his twin.</p>
<p>There followed a joyous reunion all around.
Everybody was happy to see everybody else, and
for a while it seemed as if all were trying to talk
at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a splendid trip over,&#8221; declared Mrs.
Nellie Rover. &#8220;Not a single hitch all along the
way. Tom had everything mapped out to the
last detail.&#8221; And she gave her husband an affectionate
glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what army discipline did for me,&#8221; answered
Tom Rover. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t used to be so particular.
But now I&#8217;ve got in the habit of walking
a regular chalk mark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve walked me a chalk mark, too,&#8221; put
in Hans Mueller. &#8220;I run mine delicatessen stores
chust like they vas by army regulations alreatty.
And it pays, belief me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a regular touch of old times to see you
around, Hans,&#8221; said Tom, grabbing his former
school chum by both arms. &#8220;How is that new
pickling machine getting along?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vot pickling machine you mean, Tom?&#8221; questioned
Hans, looking at him blankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that machine you&#8217;re going to invent
whereby you can grind up old oilcloth and automobile
tires and make dill pickles of them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t vas got no machine like dot, Tom,&#8221;
answered the delicatessen man in bewilderment.
&#8220;I buy mine dill pickles by der barrel. Dem dill
pickles grows, you can&#8217;t make &#8217;em by no
machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Then maybe it was a new sourkraut
stamper,&#8221; went on Tom innocently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tom, you vas joking chust like you alvays
vas!&#8221; exclaimed Hans, a light breaking in
on him. &#8220;Vell, I don&#8217;t care. You vas a pretty
goot fellow anyhow,&#8221; and Hans smiled as broadly
as ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure is a touch of old times,&#8221; declared Songbird
Powell. And then, unable to restrain himself,
he burst out:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style=' margin-left:4em;'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;From among the mountain tops</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Where the brooklet flows,</p>

<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Counting up my toes,&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>broke in Tom, with a twinkle in his merry eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Counting up my toes!&#8221; snorted Songbird.
&#8220;Nothing of the kind! You always did knock my
poetry endways, Tom. That last line was to read
like this:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style=' margin-left:4em;'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Where the sunset glows.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></div>
<p>The young folks had a grand time that evening
singing and dancing, and did not retire until the
older heads had hinted several times that they
had better do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack, it&#8217;s a splendid place to come to!&#8221;
said Ruth, when she was on the point of retiring.
&#8220;I know I&#8217;m going to have the best times ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And to think my Uncle John owns the place!&#8221;
put in May. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it simply glorious?&#8221;</p>
<p>After that the days seemed to speed along
swiftly. The boys and girls made up various
parties up and down the river, and on the hills
and in the woods. Once they got up a grand
family picnic, and everybody attended.</p>
<p>During those days the boys often wondered
whether Brassy Bangs would show himself. But
Brassy kept out of sight, and for the time being
they heard nothing further concerning him. But
they did hear through Joe Jackson of Bud Haddon.
That man had been met on the trail to Bimbel&#8217;s
ranch in company with several other persons.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were a bum-looking bunch,&#8221; declared
Jackson. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t give one of &#8217;em house room
on this ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haddon certainly didn&#8217;t make a very good
impression on me,&#8221; declared Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;m frank
to admit I think he&#8217;s a thoroughly bad egg.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>From time to time the boys had been sending
letters to some of their other school chums, and
a number of letters had come in return. One day
Gif received a long communication from Fatty
Hendry which he read in wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s something that will interest all of
you,&#8221; he declared, after he had finished. &#8220;I guess
it clears up the mystery surrounding Professor
Duke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; questioned Fred eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a letter from Fatty Hendry. He&#8217;s been
staying at a place named Ellenvale, which, as you
know, is about thirty miles north of Haven Point.
He says that Snopper Duke came from that place,
and has an aged father living there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Duke been taking care of his father?&#8221;
questioned Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And his father has been very sick and
has had to have several operations. It seems
the operations cost a lot of money, and Duke
wanted two of his younger brothers to help pay
for them. But they wouldn&#8217;t contribute a cent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, that was certainly rough!&#8221; declared
Randy. &#8220;No wonder the professor was grouchy
at times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t all of it,&#8221; went on Gif. &#8220;Fatty got
interested and made a little investigation, and he
found out that there was another brother, a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
older than the professor, who had gotten into
difficulties with the firm he was working for.
That firm was on the point of having him arrested,
so Fatty heard, but at the last minute
Professor Duke came forward and settled up for
him, so he wasn&#8217;t prosecuted.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Fatty adds in his letter that he heard this
not only took every cent the professor had, but it
also placed him in debt to Colonel Colby and some
of his friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what I call hard lines!&#8221; declared
Jack emphatically. &#8220;The poor professor must
have been worried half to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Fatty say anything further about Duke&#8217;s
father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Since the last operation the old gentleman
is feeling quite like himself again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what became of the brother who got into
trouble?&#8221; asked Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;He disappeared, and Fatty says there is a report
that he went to England, where the family
originally came from. I suppose Professor Duke
was glad to have him go.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this Gif handed around the letter so that
all might read it. After its perusal Andy was the
first to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; he said, with a deep sigh. &#8220;I&#8217;m
mighty sorry now that I didn&#8217;t treat the professor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
with more consideration. That poor man certainly
had as much of a load as anybody to
carry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to make it up to him when we get
back to Colby Hall,&#8221; declared Randy. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to show him just what I think of him,&#8221; he went
on. &#8220;He certainly was a fine fellow to help his
old father and to get his brother out of that hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys were still discussing this matter when
they suddenly saw Joe Jackson dash up to the
ranch house on his horse and dismount in great
haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, something is wrong!&#8221; declared Jack.</p>
<p>Songbird Powell and Tom and Sam Rover had
seen the approach of the foreman, and men and
boys ran out to listen to what he might have to
say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four more horses are gone!&#8221; declared Joe
Jackson. &#8220;The best horses on the ranch! And,
boss, I&#8217;m certain this time that they didn&#8217;t stray
away. They were stolen!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE CATTLE STAMPEDE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Four more horses gone!&#8221; cried Songbird
Powell in consternation. &#8220;When did this happen,
Jackson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Less than half an hour ago, over on the three-tree
range,&#8221; returned the foreman.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what makes you certain that they were
stolen this time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the horses had been left all properly
tethered. Billy Brown and his crowd had &#8217;em,
and I know Billy is a very careful man. He&#8217;s
positive they couldn&#8217;t have broken away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is certainly getting to be a serious matter,&#8221;
declared Sam Rover. &#8220;Songbird, if these
last four horses were stolen, it&#8217;s more than probable
that the first four went the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any clue to the thief or thieves?&#8221; asked Tom
Rover.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys looked around and picked up a quirt
that they say don&#8217;t belong to our outfit. But it&#8217;s
a very ordinary quirt and might belong to almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
anybody. Of course, they found a good many
hoof marks, but they were so mixed up with the
marks from the other horses they couldn&#8217;t tell
one from the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ride over to the place with you and investigate,&#8221;
returned Songbird Powell after a moment&#8217;s
thought. &#8220;Perhaps we can get on the trail
of the thieves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we go along?&#8221; questioned Spouter
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Son. We want to use the horses. And,
anyway, I think it would be better for you lads
to remain behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Songbird and the foreman hurried down to the
horse corral accompanied by Tom and Sam. And
thus the boys and girls, as well as the ladies of
the household, were left by themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! I&#8217;d like to go on a chase after those
horse thieves,&#8221; burst out Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might get a pretty warm reception if
you did that,&#8221; remarked Fred. &#8220;Horse thieves
and cattle rustlers are usually a bad bunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t likely they&#8217;ll get on the trail of the
horses very quickly,&#8221; put in Jack. &#8220;Those fellows
have too much of a start. The most they
can do is to advertise the loss as widely as possible
and trust to it that some one will recognize
the horses, especially Blackbird.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>The boys had spoken about going fishing, and
Ruth and May had asked if they could go along.
As a consequence the young folks spent the remainder
of the afternoon along the river. They
managed to catch a good mess of fish, of which
they were justly proud.</p>
<p>&#8220;And just to think! I caught two of the fish
myself!&#8221; exclaimed Ruth. &#8220;I never knew I was
going to be a fisherman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t say &#8216;fisherman;&#8217; you must say
fisherlady,&#8221; put in Andy mischievously.</p>
<p>The men did not return until ten o&#8217;clock that
night. All were tired and hungry and glad to sit
down to the meal which Mrs. Powell and the cook
provided.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a wild-goose chase,&#8221; answered Tom
Rover in reply to a question from Andy. &#8220;We
followed half a dozen clues, but they didn&#8217;t get
us anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do next, Dad?&#8221; questioned
Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sent word to Arrow Junction and several
other places, and they&#8217;ll post notices giving a description
of the stolen animals,&#8221; answered Songbird.
&#8220;And I&#8217;ve offered a hundred dollars reward
for any information leading to the recovery
of the horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day one of the cowboys came in with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
more information. This was to the effect that a
ranch in that neighborhood, owned by a man
named Cheltham, had suffered the loss of three
horses, one a mare of considerable value.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, this certainly is getting interesting,&#8221; said
Jack, when the lads heard the older heads talking
it over. &#8220;First thing we know, all the horses on
the place will be gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Years ago they used to suffer from the cattle
rustlers in this neighborhood,&#8221; said Spouter.
&#8220;But horse stealing is something new.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if that fellow Bud Haddon had anything
to do with it?&#8221; questioned Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of that,&#8221; broke in Randy. &#8220;I
think they ought to make an investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys spoke to the men about this, and there
was a long discussion which ended when Songbird
said he would ride over to the Bimbel ranch
with his foreman and interview the men.</p>
<p>The visit to the Bimbel ranch occurred the next
day, and the boys waited impatiently for the return
of the two men to learn what Bimbel and
Bud Haddon might have to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another wild-goose chase,&#8221; announced Songbird
Powell, on the return that evening. &#8220;We
saw Bimbel, and he seemed as much surprised
as anybody to learn of the horses being taken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what about Bud Haddon?&#8221; asked Jack.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t see Haddon. But Bimbel said he
had been at the ranch house early in the morning
and he was certain Haddon knew nothing about
the loss. He said Haddon and the other men
were out on a range to the westward, looking
after the cattle. Of course, if Haddon was away
out there he couldn&#8217;t have been here taking our
horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you didn&#8217;t see any trace of the animals?&#8221;
asked Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing at all. They said they hadn&#8217;t heard
of the theft nor of the loss of the horses over at
Cheltham&#8217;s ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that a week passed swiftly, during which
time the young folks enjoyed themselves thoroughly,
not only in tramping and riding around
and in fishing, but also in other sports around
the ranch home. With so much level ground
available, a tennis court had been laid out, and
also a croquet ground, and the boys and girls enjoyed
these games immensely. The lads also
pitched quoits, a sport which at times had been
popular at Colby Hall.</p>
<p>One day the boys accompanied Joe Jackson on
a round-up of some cattle far down the river.
This was a day full of excitement, for some of
the cattle broke away and Andy and Fred happened
to be separated from the rest of the crowd
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
and got directly in line with the runaway steers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi there! Hi there! Ride out of the way!&#8221;
yelled Joe Jackson at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>Andy and Fred were looking in the opposite
direction and did not notice the cattle until the
beasts were within a hundred yards of them.
Then they heard the foreman&#8217;s cry and also the
beating of the hoofs on the prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;My gracious!&#8221; gasped Fred. &#8220;Look what&#8217;s
coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get out of the way and be quick
about it,&#8221; returned Andy, and struck his horse
on the flank.</p>
<p>The steeds the boys were riding needed no urging,
for the sudden rush of the cattle filled them
with alarm. Away they bounded across the grassy
plain with the maddened cattle thundering after
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s ride to one side and let &#8217;em pass!&#8221; gasped
Fred, who was badly shaken by this sudden turn
of affairs. He had not dreamed that the herd of
cattle would head for them in this fashion.</p>
<p>But to get out of the way was not easy. To
one side of the plains was a series of rough rocks,
while to the other side there was a brook flowing
into the river, and here the ground was soft and
treacherous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go that way!&#8221; cried Andy, as he saw his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
cousin heading toward the brook. &#8220;You&#8217;ll get
stuck and you&#8217;ll never get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather get stuck than be trampled under
foot by those beasts,&#8221; panted Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Fred! Turn this way! I&#8217;m sure we
can get up on the rocks somehow!&#8221; declared
Andy.</p>
<p>The boys continued to advance with the thoroughly
frightened cattle not far behind them.
While being rounded up both cattle and cowboys
had come upon a nest of small rattlesnakes.
These had, of course, frightened the beasts, and
they were still more frightened when the cowboys
had begun to shoot at the reptiles. Then a
few of the cattle had started the stampede, and
the rest, terrorized by the pistol shots, had followed.</p>
<p>As the two lads galloped on, they looked
anxiously to the side where the rocks were located.
Most of the places they passed were too
steep to ascend. But presently Andy caught sight
of a point where there was something of a trail
leading upward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on this way!&#8221; he yelled to his cousin.
&#8220;I think we can get up on the rocks here!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Joe Jackson and his men,
followed by Jack and the others, were doing their
best to get the cattle to turn back to the point
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
from which they had started. The best herd riders
were circling the edge of the rushing animals,
shouting at the top of their lungs and firing their
pistols. But so far this demonstration had had
little effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack! do you think they&#8217;ll be run down?&#8221;
gasped Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re on a pair of good horses; they ought
to be able to outrun the cattle,&#8221; came from Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so sure of that,&#8221; cried Spouter. &#8220;A
mad steer can go some, believe me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who ever thought they would start off like
that?&#8221; went on Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was firing at those rattlesnakes did it,&#8221; declared
Jack. &#8220;Of course, I can&#8217;t blame the cowboys
for doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andy and Fred found the rocks anything but
easy to ascend. They went up a few feet, and
then the horses began to slip and were in danger
of rolling over, carrying their young riders with
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; screamed Fred. He had to catch
his horse around the neck to keep from being
flung headlong.</p>
<p>But the horses were as anxious to escape the
maddened cattle as were the lads, and the steeds
continued to scramble upward until they reached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
a ledge of rock where the footing was comparatively
level.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think we&#8217;ll be all right here?&#8221; panted
Fred, when he could catch his breath sufficiently
to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall be unless some of those steers take it
into their heads to climb the rocks the same way
we did,&#8221; answered Andy. He was suffering from
a slight bruise on his left leg where he had brushed
some of the roughest of the rocks.</p>
<p>The horses were still alarmed, and continued to
snort and stamp their feet, and the two lads for a
few seconds had their hands full quieting the animals.
They looked below them and saw the cattle
coming on in a great mass. Some had already
passed, but others were huddled close to the rocks
as if on the point of making an ascent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really think they&#8217;ll try to come up,&#8221; said
Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come ahead! We&#8217;ll see if we can&#8217;t get a little
higher up,&#8221; answered Andy. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think the
steers will follow us very far, even if they do
come. We can shoot at them if we have to,&#8221; he
added, for each of them carried a pistol.</p>
<p>Beyond the ledge were more rough rocks, and
here the two lads had to proceed with caution
for fear one of their horses might slip and perhaps
break a leg. As they advanced they looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
back and saw that the cowboys were coming closer
and were beginning to drive a part of the cattle
to the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if only they can drive them back!&#8221; sighed
Fred. &#8220;Just look at &#8217;em, Andy! There must be
a hundred of the steers directly below us! And
see how angry that big black fellow looks! He
acts just as if he&#8217;d like to come up here and gore
us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; ejaculated Andy, pulling back on the
rein. &#8220;What&#8217;s that funny noise?&#8221;</p>
<p>Both listened, and, mingled with the murmurs
of the cattle at the foot of the rocks, came to
their ears a peculiar whine or growl that was entirely
new to the lads.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wild animal of some kind!&#8221; cried Fred,
as the growl was repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did it come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. But it was close at hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thoroughly scared, both boys looked on all
sides. Then, of a sudden, Fred let out another
exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is! Right on the shelf of rocks yonder!
Oh, Andy, it&#8217;s a mountain lion!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE MOUNTAIN LION</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a time of extreme peril, and both of the
Rover boys realized it. The shelf of rock was
not over twenty feet ahead of them, and on this
rested the mountain lion, crouched as if for a
spring.</p>
<p>Fred had scarcely spoken when both horses
began to snort and stamp their feet as if wanting
to turn and run away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; screamed Andy, &#8220;or the horses will
take us right back among those mad cattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the discovery of the mountain lion, that
lay close to the rocky shelf with glaring eyes and
tail that swept nervously from side to side, the
boys had noted that the animal was as much
penned in as they were themselves. Beyond the
shelf was an overhanging cliff, so that further
progress in that direction was cut off completely.
Had this not been so, it is more than likely that
the mountain lion would have turned and slunk
away, for like all wild beasts they do not fight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
unless they think it is necessary to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on&mdash;give him a shot!&#8221; exclaimed Fred,
as soon as he could recover from his astonishment.</p>
<p>His weapon was handy, and in a moment the
pistol rang out sharply, and this shot was followed
by one from his cousin.</p>
<p>Had the two boys been on the ground their
shots might have been more effective. But it was
another task to aim from the back of a restive
horse that was threatening every instant to bolt,
and so both bullets merely grazed the mountain
lion&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>But these shots, mingled with those coming
from the plain below, had one good effect. The
cattle had been stopped in their mad flight and
now they turned back in the direction in which
the cowboys wanted them to go.</p>
<p>As the pistols rang out the mountain lion gave
a scream of commingled pain and rage. Then it
crept forward several feet and made a movement
as if on the point of leaping for Fred and his
steed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back up! Back up, Fred!&#8221; yelled Andy, and
fired a second time, and his cousin did likewise.</p>
<p>This time the aim of the boys was better, and
the mountain lion was hit in one of the forelegs
and in the flank. It made a sudden leap, but the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
wound in the leg made it fall short, and it fell
down between the rocks directly in front of where
Fred&#8217;s horse was standing.</p>
<p>As the mountain lion went down in the hollow
the horse uttered another wild snort and an instant
later leaped directly over the wild beast,
coming down at the foot of the rocky ledge beyond.
The steed Andy rode backed violently until
some other rocks stopped its retreat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi there! What are you shooting at?&#8221; came
a cry from below, and the two boys recognized
the voice of Joe Jackson.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lion!&#8221; called back Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then plug him! Plug him quick!&#8221; yelled
Jackson. &#8220;Plug him before he gets a chance to
get at you!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no need for this advice, for Andy
was already taking aim. This time the bullet
passed through the body of the lion and the beast
leaped up, turning over and over convulsively.
Then Fred managed to steady his mount for a
moment, and he, too, fired, this time catching the
mountain lion in the ear. Then the beast gave a
final leap and tumbled down the rocks almost at
the feet of the astonished ranch foreman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you hurt?&#8221; demanded Jackson anxiously,
as he gave a glance at the lion to make certain that
it was breathing its last.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; came from both of the boys. But it
must be confessed that their voices were trembling.
They had all they could do to quiet their
horses, the steeds showing a great inclination to
leap over the rough rocks and run away.</p>
<p>By the time that Fred and Andy managed to
descend to the plain below them the stampede of
the cattle, which had been only momentary, was
coming to an end, only two steers having run
away for parts unknown.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;ll come back, Boss,&#8221; said one of the
cowboys to Jackson. &#8220;They always do. You
can&#8217;t hire &#8217;em to herd by themselves. They&#8217;ll sure
be back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A mountain lion! What do you know about
that!&#8221; exclaimed Jack, as he came riding up, followed
by the other boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he hurt you at all?&#8221; questioned Spouter
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t get a chance,&#8221; answered Fred, just a
bit proudly. &#8220;Andy and I let drive at him almost
as soon as we saw him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A pretty powerful beast, I&#8217;ll say,&#8221; remarked
Gif, as he made an examination of the lion that
was now dead. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d like to face such
a creature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to fight him,&#8221; declared Andy. &#8220;He
was right up on that rocky shelf yonder, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
couldn&#8217;t back out. If he had had the chance he&#8217;d
have leaped right on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re the prize hunters of this crowd,&#8221;
declared Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t put that down to hunting,&#8221; answered
his twin promptly. &#8220;That was simply a
case of necessity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, you&#8217;ve got the lion, and that skin will
make some rug,&#8221; declared Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if there are any other mountain lions
around?&#8221; remarked Gif. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to get a shot
at one of them myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They often travel in pairs,&#8221; answered Joe
Jackson. &#8220;But if you&#8217;re going after lions you
had better arm yourselves with rifles. It was only
good luck that brought this beast down with pistol
bullets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The pistols were good enough at close quarters,&#8221;
answered Andy. &#8220;Just the same, I&#8217;d rather
shoot the next mountain lion from a distance,&#8221;
he added dryly.</p>
<p>Of course, when the boys rode up to the ranch
home with the carcass of the dead lion there was
a good deal of excitement among the older folks
and the girls, and Fred and Andy had to tell
their story in detail.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really must be more careful in the future,
boys,&#8221; declared Mrs. Sam Rover. &#8220;Why, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
might have been trampled under foot by the cattle,
as well as chewed up by this mountain lion!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know there was any danger of the cattle
stampeding,&#8221; put in Mrs. Tom Rover.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jackson assures me that the stampede
wasn&#8217;t of much consequence,&#8221; remarked Songbird
Powell. &#8220;But, of course, the boys shouldn&#8217;t have
gotten in front of the animals. But this question
of facing a mountain lion is another story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Py chimminy! you don&#8217;t vas cotch me facin&#8217;
no mountain lions,&#8221; declared Hans Mueller emphatically.
&#8220;I did me dot years ago, ven I go
oud mit your faders. But I ton&#8217;t do him no more
alreatty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Fred, you must be more careful!&#8221; protested
May to the youngest Rover, when she got
the chance. &#8220;Suppose that lion had jumped right
on top of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe me, May, I didn&#8217;t want to get so
close,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;When we discovered the
beast he wasn&#8217;t over twenty feet away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they told us there weren&#8217;t very many wild
beasts around here!&#8221; came from Martha. &#8220;After
this I guess we had better be careful how we
roam through the woods and along the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re not likely to harm you unless you
corner them,&#8221; said Songbird Powell. &#8220;They&#8217;ll
sneak away from you if you give them half a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
chance. It&#8217;s only when they&#8217;re cornered or when
they&#8217;re needing food that they are really combative.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mountain lion was skinned and the pelt
taken away by the ranch foreman to be cured, and
then Fred and Andy took it easy for the rest of
the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it queer that Brassy Bangs has never
showed himself around this place?&#8221; remarked
Spouter that evening. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you think he&#8217;d
at least ride over to see what sort of an outfit we
had here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More than likely he&#8217;s afraid of his welcome,&#8221;
said Jack. &#8220;He knows that none of us care for
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know if he really started that auto,&#8221;
put in Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, what a sour fellow that Jarley Bangs
was!&#8221; exclaimed Andy.</p>
<p>There had been an indication of a storm, but
this had passed away, and one day found the
Rover boys and their chums off on a trip along
a trail which led across the river and to the mountains
westward, a trail which they were informed
by Jackson led between the ranches owned by
Jarley Bangs and Bimbel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to get a better view of Bimbel&#8217;s ranch
and also of Bangs&#8217; place,&#8221; declared Jack. &#8220;And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
maybe we&#8217;ll see something of Bud Haddon and
his crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of the boys were now on good terms with
Hop Lung, and he had prepared for them a substantial
lunch and also something extra in case
they should remain out after the supper hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you lads take good care of yourselves,&#8221;
admonished Tom Rover, when they were ready to
depart on their day&#8217;s outing. &#8220;No more rattlesnakes
or mountain lions!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or mix-ups with runaway cattle,&#8221; put in Sam
Rover.</p>
<p>Spouter and Jack carried small rifles, and the
others were armed with pistols. They, however,
were not going out to hunt, but thought best to
provide themselves with the firearms in case any
game presented itself.</p>
<p>It did not take the boys long to cross the river,
and then they followed a trail which led up a
long hill and through a somewhat dense forest.</p>
<p>They had journeyed along the best part of two
hours when they noticed the sun going under a
cloud. This caused the trail under the trees to
become dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! I wonder if we&#8217;re going to have a
storm?&#8221; remarked Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, maybe it&#8217;s nothing but a wind cloud,&#8221;
answered Spouter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>They continued to move along the trail, and
presently reached a small opening where there was
a spring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; called out Jack, who was riding ahead
with Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; questioned Gif quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look there! Isn&#8217;t that a wolf?&#8221; asked Jack.
He pointed with his rifle, which he had already
unslung, and all the boys looked in the direction
pointed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a dog,&#8221; put in Fred quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to shoot somebody&#8217;s pet,&#8221; admonished
Gif.</p>
<p>The animal had slunk away behind some brushwood,
and now they saw it trying to retreat, pulling
something through the dead leaves as it did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wolf! I&#8217;m sure of it!&#8221; declared Jack,
and, raising his rifle, he took quick aim and fired.</p>
<p>As the echo of the firearm died away the lads
heard a snarl and a yelp, and an instant later a
gaunt wolf showed himself, his fangs gleaming
dangerously as he came closer.</p>
<p>Several shots rang out, for all of the boys had
their weapons ready. The wolf was hit in three
places, and gave a single leap into the air and
then dropped lifeless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! We&#8217;ve got him!&#8221; yelled Randy, with
satisfaction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful! Don&#8217;t go too close before we&#8217;re
sure,&#8221; warned Jack. &#8220;Better reload first.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the wolf was past doing further harm, and
having assured themselves of this the boys looked
at what he had been carrying away.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the side of a calf!&#8221; exclaimed Spouter.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this the limit? I&#8217;m glad we brought him
down!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have been raiding some cow yard,&#8221;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;No ranch cow yard,&#8221; said Gif. &#8220;This half of
a calf was skinned by some person. I&#8217;ll bet he
stole it out of some ranch larder.&#8221; And later on
it was learned that the calf meat had been stolen
from Jarley Bangs&#8217; place the night before.</p>
<p>The boys had become so interested in bringing
down the wolf that they had paid no attention to
what was taking place overhead. But now they
noticed that the sky was more overcast than ever.
The wind began to blow through the woods, and
of a sudden there came a downpour as surprising
as it was dismaying.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>IN THE CAVE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in for it now!&#8221; cried Jack, as he looked
up at the sky and at the trees beginning to bend
in the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s going to be some storm, or I miss my
guess,&#8221; added Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if we can find any shelter around
here?&#8221; put in Randy. &#8220;If we can&#8217;t we&#8217;ll be soaked
to the skin in no time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jackson was telling me of a couple of caves
toward the end of these woods,&#8221; said Spouter
quickly. &#8220;I wonder if we could reach the nearest
of them? It might help us to get out of the
rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on&mdash;let&#8217;s try it!&#8221; put in Fred eagerly.</p>
<p>Leaving the dead wolf where it had fallen, the
boys pushed forward on the trail, which now led
downward on the other side of the hill. Here
they noticed the going was getting rougher, and
presently they found themselves entering a defile
among the rocks. Here the trees were more scattering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
and consequently they were exposed to the
full fury of the elements. Ever and anon a flash
of lightning would illumine the sky, followed by
the crack and rumble of thunder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, maybe we had better stay under the
trees,&#8221; suggested Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose the trees should be struck by lightning?&#8221;
questioned Jack. &#8220;I think we had better
go on, especially if we&#8217;re anywhere near those
caves Jackson mentioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>A turn in the defile brought them to something
of an open place. Here on one side the rocks
towered fully fifty feet above their heads and at
one point there was an opening perhaps fifteen
feet square and leading into the side of the hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;This must be the first of the caves!&#8221; cried
Spouter. &#8220;Come on in!&#8221; And without ceremony
he led the way, and the others followed, glad to
get out of the storm.</p>
<p>They found the cave an irregular one, running
in somewhat of a semicircle and with a flooring
that was comparatively level. It was dry and
fairly comfortable, and once beyond the fury of
the storm the lads dismounted and proceeded to
make themselves at home.</p>
<p>The rain continued to come down and, with
nothing better to do, the boys proceeded to make
themselves as comfortable as possible. Near the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
entrance to the cave they found some leaves and
dead tree branches which were still dry, and these
they dragged inside and then made themselves a
campfire.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ll have to cut out going any
further,&#8221; announced Spouter. &#8220;Even if the storm
clears away, the trail will be very wet and slippery.&#8221;</p>
<p>It still lacked an hour to noon, and with nothing
else to do the boys tethered their horses and
then proceeded to investigate their surroundings.
From the campfire they obtained several torches,
and with these in hand they moved along slowly
around the bend of the cave and over a series of
rocks which led upward.</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is a larger cave than I supposed,&#8221;
said Jack, as he and Gif led the way, with the
others close behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I see a light ahead, Jack,&#8221; was Gif&#8217;s
remark. &#8220;That must be another opening to the
cave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the two caves that Jackson mentioned
are really one, and this passageway connects
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time all but one of the torches had burnt
themselves out. But this the lads did not mind,
for the light ahead was steadily increasing, showing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
that they could not be far from another opening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; called Jack suddenly. And then he
added: &#8220;Keep quiet, all of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed ahead and there, around a bend of
the rocks, all saw two figures moving around on
horseback. One was the figure of a tall man, and
the other that of a well-grown youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s Brassy Bangs!&#8221; whispered Fred
excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And the man is Bud Haddon,&#8221; returned
Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you bet Haddon isn&#8217;t after Brassy
for more money?&#8221; put in Fred excitedly.</p>
<p>While the youngest Rover was speaking, he and
the others saw that the two figures on horseback
had disappeared behind a mass of rocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going ahead and find out about this,&#8221; declared
Jack. &#8220;Come on! So far as we can see
there are only two of them, so the six of us have
nothing to fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially as we&#8217;re armed,&#8221; added Fred, who
carried his pistol with him.</p>
<p>Throwing down the last of their torches, the
six boys advanced with caution. They heard the
horses beyond the rocks occasionally stamping a
hoof and caught a faint murmur of voices. Then,
led by Jack, they mounted the rocks noiselessly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
presently gaining a point where they could look
directly down upon Brassy Bangs and his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all wrong, Bud Haddon, and you know
it!&#8221; they heard Brassy declare. &#8220;And sooner or
later the authorities will get after you for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Lester Bangs, you don&#8217;t have to
preach to me!&#8221; growled Bud Haddon. &#8220;You&#8217;re
just as deep in some things as I am in others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t true, and you know it!&#8221; whined Brassy.
And now the lads who were listening could see
that their fellow-cadet was very much upset. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not guilty, and I never have been guilty of any
wrongdoing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You tell that to the police and see what they
have to say about it,&#8221; sneered Haddon, &#8220;You
know well enough that you set fire to John Calder&#8217;s
barn and burnt up horses that was worth
thousands of dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I always said it was some cowboys or
tramps that did it!&#8221; stormed Brassy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much! You did it! I know it, and so
do Jillson and Dusenbury! We&#8217;ve got the goods
on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What were Jillson and Dusenbury and you doing
around the place?&#8221; questioned Brassy suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind what we were doing around there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
We know you set the barn on fire. Didn&#8217;t you
have a quarrel with old Calder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did. But I didn&#8217;t make any fire.
Maybe you had a quarrel with him yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on there, Bangs! None of that!&#8221; cried
Bud Haddon sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you wouldn&#8217;t be too good to set the fire,&#8221;
added Brassy, with sudden recklessness. &#8220;Not
after the way you are acting out here, running
away with those horses, and after the way you
acted at Colby Hall, trying to rob every room in
the place!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute now! Wait a minute!&#8221; returned
the man sarcastically. &#8220;Who was it lent
me his uniform and who was it that told me just
what rooms to go into? Answer me those questions,
will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have gotten hold of the uniform
and you wouldn&#8217;t have gotten any information
if you hadn&#8217;t threatened me in all sorts of
ways,&#8221; answered Brassy, somewhat lamely. &#8220;I
wish now that I&#8217;d never had anything to do with
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you keep your tongue between your
teeth, or else you&#8217;ll get yourself in the hottest kind
of water!&#8221; burst out Bud Haddon. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
know that they can send you to prison for ten
years for what you did?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t said anything to anybody as yet,&#8221;
answered Brassy hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see that you don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t set Calder&#8217;s barn on fire&mdash;really
I didn&#8217;t!&#8221; pleaded the boy. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you
won&#8217;t believe me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to let that matter drop if only
you&#8217;ll keep a civil tongue in your head and mind
what you&#8217;re doing,&#8221; returned Bud Haddon. &#8220;And
don&#8217;t forget&mdash;I want at least a hundred dollars
more just as soon as you can lay your hands on
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how I&#8217;m going to get it. I&#8217;m expecting
some money from my uncle. But that
has got to pay for my tuition at Colby Hall this
fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you let the school wait for its money
and you turn it over to me. They won&#8217;t want
you there anyhow if they should find out what
sort of a fellow you are,&#8221; went on Bud Haddon
coarsely. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ve got to be getting back to
Bimbel&#8217;s, rain or no rain,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Just
remember, you&#8217;ve got to fork over a hundred in
cold cash before you start East again. If you
don&#8217;t&mdash;well, look out, that&#8217;s all!&#8221; And with this
threat the tall man rode out of the cave.</p>
<p>The Rovers and their chums had listened to
every word that had been spoken. They were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
both mystified and amazed by what had been said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow Haddon is surely a first-class rascal,&#8221;
whispered Spouter to Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what I think we had better do?&#8221;
returned the young major. &#8220;Let&#8217;s stop Brassy
and have a straight talk with him. I don&#8217;t think
he&#8217;s quite as bad as we thought he might be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, let us stop Brassy by all means,&#8221; came
in a low tone from Fred.</p>
<p>Brassy Bangs had ridden to the mouth of the
cave and there sat astride of his horse, watching
Bud Haddon as he galloped away though the rain.
Then he turned back in anything but a cheerful
humor. The other boys saw him dismount and
sink down on a rock, covering his face with his
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; said Jack, and without more ado
he scrambled down from the rocks and came
around to where Brassy was sitting, and the others
did the same.</p>
<p>Brassy&#8217;s misery was so great that for several
seconds he did not notice their approach. Then,
he looked up startled and leaped to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221; he demanded,
as soon as he could speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came from the other end of the cave,
Brassy,&#8221; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you been here?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been here long enough to hear the talk
you had with that fellow named Haddon,&#8221; answered
Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did!&#8221; Brassy turned pale. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t
very nice to listen when you had no business to!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind about that now, Brassy. What
we want to know is, did you or that fellow rob
Colby Hall?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did it! I didn&#8217;t have a thing to do with
it&mdash;at least, willingly!&#8221; cried Brassy Bangs. &#8220;He
forced me to do everything I did. He threatened
me in all sorts of ways&mdash;said he would put me
in prison and all that if I didn&#8217;t help him. Oh,
he&#8217;s the worst man there ever was!&#8221; groaned the
overwrought boy. And now the others could see
that he was on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Brassy, why don&#8217;t you tell us the
whole story?&#8221; put in Gif kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I tell my story to you? All you
fellows are against me&mdash;you always were!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not against you, Brassy,&#8221; answered
Jack. &#8220;If you can prove to us that you&#8217;re really
being hounded by that man, we&#8217;ll do what we can
to help you. Isn&#8217;t that so, fellows?&#8221; And at
this question the others nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hounded is right! He&#8217;s done nothing but
hound me ever since he knew me,&#8221; whined the
accused one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You tell me one thing!&#8221; demanded Spouter,
striding up and catching Brassy by the shoulder.
&#8220;Did that rascal steal the horses from our ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he did&mdash;in fact, I&#8217;m about certain he
did. That is, either he or the fellows he&#8217;s in league
with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are those other fellows?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two fellows who just came out here from
Chicago named Jillson and Dusenbury and two
others from Bimbel&#8217;s ranch named Noxley and
Jenks. The whole bunch were mixed up with
Bimbel some years ago in a shady transaction,
and they lit out for quite a while. But now
they&#8217;re back again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you want to get mixed up
with a crowd like that,&#8221; was Andy&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to get mixed up with &#8217;em,&#8221; declared
Brassy. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t had a thing to do with
any of &#8217;em except Bud Haddon. Oh, I wish I&#8217;d
never met that man!&#8221; And now Brassy seemed
almost on the verge of tears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>A CONFESSION</h3>
</div>

<p>After that it was an easy matter for the other
boys to get Brassy to make a complete confession.</p>
<p>&#8220;My first trouble came when I got a job with
John Calder who has a farm on the outskirts of
Omaha,&#8221; said Brassy. &#8220;I had had a quarrel at
home, and also a quarrel with my uncle here, and
had made up my mind to get a place and support
myself. But I couldn&#8217;t get along with Calder,
who was a very strict man, and one afternoon we
had a lively quarrel, and I told him I&#8217;d leave, and
I did so and went to Omaha. About a week after
that Calder&#8217;s barn burned down and a number of
horses were caught in the fire. That was just
after I had fallen in with Bud Haddon and his
two chums, Jillson and Dusenbury. Haddon pretended
to be quite friendly. But all at once he
accused me of setting the fire and said that Jillson
and Dusenbury, who had left the day before,
could prove it. I protested my innocence, but he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
insisted I was guilty and worked me up to such
an extent that I gave him almost every dollar I
had in my pocket to keep him quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you say positively that you had nothing
to do with the fire?&#8221; questioned Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you prove that you weren&#8217;t there
when the fire took place?&#8221; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I couldn&#8217;t, because I went to a vaudeville
show that evening, and I was among strangers, so
that I couldn&#8217;t account for my time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Haddon hound you when you came to
Colby Hall?&#8221; questioned Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly did&mdash;not once, but half a dozen
times. And I gave him all the money I could
scrape up. In fact, I even borrowed some money
from Halliday and a couple of the other fellows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about the robbery at the Hall?&#8217;&#8221;
questioned Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Several times Haddon came to me and spoke
in a mysterious manner about its being an easy
matter to make a big haul. Then he hinted about
the robbery; but I would have nothing to do with
it. On the afternoon when we were getting ready
to celebrate that night, he sent word that he
wanted to see me at a certain barn not far from
the school. When I got there he demanded that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
I help him go through the bedrooms while the
fellows were having a good time on the campus
and down by the river. I said I wouldn&#8217;t do it,
and then all of a sudden he hit me on the head
and knocked me down. Then he stripped me of
my trousers and jacket and tied me fast in one
of the disused horse stalls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you mean to say he used your uniform
in stealing into the school?&#8221; asked Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. I didn&#8217;t know it at the time, because
he went to another part of the barn where I
couldn&#8217;t see him. But later on, when he brought
the uniform back, he told me all about it. He
thought he had been wonderfully slick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you expose him at once?&#8221; demanded
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me that if I exposed him he would tell
the authorities that I had planned the whole
scheme and that I had done most of the work myself.
He said some one had seen him in the uniform
scooting from one room to another, so that
the report would circulate that some cadet was
guilty. He got me so worked up that at last I
promised to keep quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And had he really robbed your room, too?&#8221;
demanded Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I lost my stuff just as I reported. Oh,
you can&#8217;t imagine how I felt!&#8221; went on Brassy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
Bangs in a hopeless tone of voice. &#8220;Many a time
I thought I&#8217;d go to Colonel Colby and confess
everything. But then I thought they would bring
that old charge of barn-burning up against me, as
well as the charge of helping in the robbery, and
I didn&#8217;t have nerve enough to say a word. Oh,
I know I was a big fool! I should have faced it
out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221; put in Jack suddenly. &#8220;Are
you pretty sure Haddon, as well as Dusenbury and
Jillson, are guilty of making off with the horses
that are missing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, isn&#8217;t it possible that those three
went to this John Calder&#8217;s barn and stole some of
the horses and then set fire to the place to cover
the theft?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By golly, I&#8217;ll bet that&#8217;s just what they did!&#8221;
burst out Brassy Bangs. &#8220;I remember now that
the reports in the newspapers said the fire had
been so fierce that the carcasses of the horses had
been burnt up completely. They only found some
of the bones in the ruins. Oh, if they really did
do that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Calder have any particularly good
horses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he had a splendid team of matched grays
that were worth considerable money. He thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
more of the grays than he did of all his other
horses put together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager a toothpick against a lemon that
gang stole the grays before the fire,&#8221; declared
Andy emphatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;The police ought to arrest those three men and
put &#8217;em through what they call the third degree,&#8221;
remarked Gif.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know one other thing,&#8221; went on
Andy, and now his face showed a slight grin.
&#8220;What do you know about your Uncle Jarley&#8217;s
auto running away by itself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t mention that tin junk
wagon!&#8221; pleaded Brassy. &#8220;I started it, and the
blamed thing ran over me, and I was lame for a
week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does your uncle know anything about what
Haddon and his crowd are up to?&#8221; questioned
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly. Although he&#8217;s becoming suspicious
of the whole gang around the Bimbel
place. You know he&#8217;s never trusted Bimbel since
the man got into difficulty with the authorities
several years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that the seven boys talked the matter
over for half an hour longer. And then the others
insisted upon it that Brassy accompany them
to the other entrance to the cave, and there all sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
down to partake of the lunch brought from Big
Horn Ranch.</p>
<p>Brassy appeared much relieved by the confession
he had made, and readily answered all the
questions put to him. His assertive manner had
left him entirely, and he appeared quite humble.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he ever gets out of this I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;ll be a
different fellow,&#8221; whispered Randy to Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so myself,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;But how
he is going to square himself with Colonel Colby
remains to be seen. It was a serious piece of
business to let Haddon steal all those things from
the school and say nothing about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the boys were eating the storm stopped,
and less than an hour later the sun was shining as
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we might as well be on our way back
to the ranch,&#8221; remarked Spouter. &#8220;The sooner
we get there and let our fathers know how matters
stand, the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to go with us, Brassy?&#8221; asked
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I did that I couldn&#8217;t get back to my uncle&#8217;s
place to-night, and then he&#8217;d worry about me.
Otherwise I would just as lief go to your place
as not. Now that I&#8217;ve told you everything I&#8217;d
like to see the whole matter cleaned up, and quick
too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How far is it to your uncle&#8217;s ranch?&#8221; asked
Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not over a mile and a half.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then suppose we go there first, and then all of
us can strike out for Big Horn Ranch. Maybe
your uncle will want to take part in what is going
on,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would go with me!&#8221; cried Brassy
eagerly. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid my uncle will raise Cain
when I tell him the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t dare do much when we&#8217;re around,&#8221;
answered Gif. &#8220;If he gets too ugly you can clear
out and meet us on the way to our place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk,&#8221; said Randy.</p>
<p>Again there was a discussion, but in the end it
was decided that the whole party should lose no
time in getting to Jarley Bangs&#8217; ranch. They
would explain matters to Brassy&#8217;s uncle, and then
set out for Songbird Powell&#8217;s place.</p>
<p>The campfire was speedily stamped out, and
leaping into the saddle, the seven boys set out for
the Bangs&#8217; place, Brassy leading the way, with
Spouter beside him. It was a wet and dismal ride
through the woods, and it is safe to say that
Brassy felt every bit as dismal as his surroundings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, but I certainly am sorry for him!&#8221; whispered
Andy to his twin. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t a fellow that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
I would cotton to, but he certainly has got himself
into a pickle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently the woods were left behind and they
came out on the open prairie. Here the sun shone
brightly, and the trail was drying rapidly. They
urged their steeds into a gallop, and in a short
while came in sight of the Jarley Bangs&#8217; outfit.</p>
<p>As they rode up they saw Jarley Bangs come
from the ranch house and move swiftly toward
one of the stables where the horses were kept. He
was evidently in a hurry and much excited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! where have you been?&#8221; he demanded
of his nephew. &#8220;Where did you pick up these
chaps?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I met &#8217;em during the storm over at Twin
Caves,&#8221; answered Brassy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder you wouldn&#8217;t stay around the
house once in a while,&#8221; grumbled Jarley Bangs.
&#8220;If you would, maybe I wouldn&#8217;t be losing
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Losing things! What do you mean, Uncle
Jarley?&#8221; questioned the nephew quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do I mean?&#8221; stormed the ranch owner.
&#8220;Do you know what has happened since you went
away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll tell you! Two of our best
horses have been stolen! Right out of the stable,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
too!&#8221; exclaimed Jarley Bangs wrathfully. &#8220;Duster
and old Whitehead!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stolen!&#8221; came from all of the boys simultaneously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, stolen! Nobody saw &#8217;em taken, but
they&#8217;re gone, and not a man on the ranch was near
&#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager that&#8217;s more of Bud Haddon&#8217;s
work,&#8221; declared Jack quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he wasn&#8217;t here&mdash;he was over at the
caves,&#8221; returned Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if he didn&#8217;t do it, then some members
of his gang did,&#8221; put in Randy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to have the law on somebody for
this!&#8221; stormed Jarley Bangs. &#8220;Too many horses
in this neighborhood have been stolen. I&#8217;m going
to visit some of the other ranchmen and notify
the sheriff, and see if we can&#8217;t raise a posse to
run down the rascals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to talk, Mr. Bangs!&#8221; cried
Spouter. &#8220;And we know just what gang to go
after.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE CAPTURE&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>

<p>Less than an hour later found the whole party,
including Jarley Bangs, on the way to Big Horn
Ranch.</p>
<p>Brassy&#8217;s uncle had listened with keen interest
to the story his nephew and the other lads had to
relate. He had interrupted a number of times to
ask questions, and at the finish of the recital had
held up both hands in disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a bigger fool than I ever thought you
were, Lester,&#8221; he had told his nephew. &#8220;Why in
thunder didn&#8217;t you tell your folks and me all about
this just as soon as it happened? We could have
set a trap for those rascals and caught &#8217;em easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Uncle Jarley, remember how I was tied
up in that Colby Hall affair!&#8221; Brassy had pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe Colonel Colby would hold you
responsible for that&mdash;not after he&#8217;d made a thorough
investigation. But that ain&#8217;t here nor there.
What we want to do now is to grab those fellows
before they&#8217;ve a chance to make a get-away. I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
just like to ketch &#8217;em with Duster and Whitehead
in their possession! I think I could find
enough old-timers around here to hand all of &#8217;em a
rope,&#8221; and Jarley Bangs&#8217; eyes had flashed with a
fire that was anything but agreeable.</p>
<p>The Rover boys and their chums had thought to
take the regular trail leading back to Big Horn
Ranch, but Jarley Bangs told them he knew of a
shorter way.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can cut off over a mile,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And
I reckon the quicker we get a posse out the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you suppose we can round them up
around Bimbel&#8217;s ranch almost any time?&#8221; queried
Spouter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, and maybe not. We&#8217;d probably be
able to get the others, but Haddon, Dusenbury
and Jillson come and go. Sometimes they&#8217;re here,
and sometimes in Omaha and Chicago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps that&#8217;s where they disposed of their
stolen horses,&#8221; suggested Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;More&#8217;n likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jarley Bangs had armed himself with a double-barreled
shotgun, and he rode in advance with
Spouter at his side and the others close behind.</p>
<p>The way lay across a stretch of prairie and
then into the edge of the woods bordering the
river. The party had just gained the water&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
edge and were looking for a good fording place
when Brassy suddenly uttered an exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look up the river, will you? There are those
men now! And see! they are leading a couple
of horses!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get back out of sight, quick!&#8221; ordered Jarley
Bangs. And in a few seconds all were behind the
bushes which at that point lined the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, they&#8217;re heading almost straight for Big
Horn Ranch!&#8221; exclaimed Spouter excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going to follow the old river trail,&#8221;
announced Jarley Bangs. &#8220;More&#8217;n likely they&#8217;ll
take to the lower trail when they reach the forks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we head &#8217;em off and capture &#8217;em?&#8221;
questioned Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we can. Anyhow, we can try,&#8221; was
Jarley Bangs&#8217; answer.</p>
<p>The old ranchman made a swift mental calculation
and then directed the boys to follow him to
a fording place a little further down the river.
Once on the other side of the watercourse, he
urged his steed forward at topmost speed in the
direction of another patch of timber further southward.</p>
<p>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t dare take the upper trail,&#8221; he
told the lads. &#8220;For that would take &#8217;em too close
to Big Horn. They&#8217;ll come this way, I&#8217;m almost
certain.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>It was not easy riding on a trail which was
used but seldom. Nevertheless, the lads hurried
after the old ranchman as well as they could.
They wound in and out over some rough rocks
and up a small hill, and presently emerged upon
a much better trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is where they ought to pass,&#8221; announced
Jarley Bangs. &#8220;Now then, we&#8217;ll put our horses
in the thicket and then see what we can do toward
pocketing &#8217;em when they come.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old ranchman had seen strenuous times in
his younger days, and he seemed to know exactly
what to do. He divided the boys into two groups,
placing them on either side of the winding and
rocky road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now if you have to shoot, shoot high so as
not to hit anybody on the other side,&#8221; was his
warning. &#8220;But maybe we can get &#8217;em without
firing a shot,&#8221; he went on.</p>
<p>Brassy was armed with a small rifle, and he insisted
upon remaining in the roadway with his
uncle. The other lads with their pistols and guns
were placed in advantageous positions behind
nearby rocks and trees.</p>
<p>The arrangement was scarcely completed when
they heard the tramp of horses&#8217; hoofs over the
somewhat rocky trail, and in a minute more Bud
Haddon came into view, followed by Jillson and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
Dusenbury, all on horseback and each of the latter
leading an extra steed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw up your hands!&#8221; shouted Jarley Bangs,
as the horsemen came closer, and he leveled his
shotgun full at Haddon&#8217;s head, while Brassy covered
Dusenbury with his rifle. The boys behind
the rocks and trees covered all three men as well
as they were able.</p>
<p>The three rascals had not anticipated such a
meeting, and, seeing the guns leveled at them, not
only from the front but also from the sides, three
pairs of hands went up almost as one.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Bangs!&#8221; murmured the man named Dusenbury.
&#8220;I reckon the jig is up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t dare to budge or I&#8217;ll blow somebody&#8217;s
head off!&#8221; roared Jarley Bangs. And he looked
as if he meant what he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the drop on me, and I ain&#8217;t moving,&#8221;
answered Bud Haddon surlily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, Powell! Come out here, will you?&#8221; went
on Brassy Bangs&#8217; uncle. And then, as Spouter
came from the bushes with rifle in hand, he continued.
&#8220;Go up there and take every one of their
guns away from &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as they had been disarmed the three
rascals were told to dismount and stand in a line
along the side of the road. Then, as the boys
confronted them, Jarley Bangs went through their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
pockets once more to make sure that no weapon
had been overlooked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine piece of business, to run away with my
horses!&#8221; exclaimed the old ranch owner, and he
jerked his head in the direction of the two animals
the men had been leading.</p>
<p>With their hands tied in front of them, the
men were made to remount, and then the entire
party lost no time in heading for Big Horn Ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix you for this!&#8221; hissed Haddon at Brassy
when he got the chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do your worst!&#8221; retorted the boy. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not afraid of you any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there was great excitement at the
ranch when the crowd came in with the three
prisoners. The story of what had happened was
quickly circulated, and Joe Jackson and a number
of the cowboys were called in from the ranges.
One of the cowboys was sent off to notify a deputy
sheriff of what had occurred and of what the
ranch owners expected to do, and two other cowboys
were started off to notify the owners of other
ranches in that vicinity.</p>
<p>As a consequence early the next morning a
posse consisting of twelve men headed for Bimbel&#8217;s
ranch. Of course, the boys wanted to go
along, but they were forced to remain behind,
much to their chagrin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You might get shot,&#8221; said Songbird Powell.
&#8220;And, besides that, you have had glory enough,
helping to catch these three rascals,&#8221; and he smiled
faintly.</p>
<p>The affair at Bimbel&#8217;s was rather a strenuous
one. Jenks and Noxley, as well as Bimbel, tried
to escape, and Noxley was shot in the leg. The
fellow thought he was going to die, and while
waiting for the doctor to come and attend him
he made a full confession concerning the stealing
of many of the horses in that neighborhood.
He said that Bud Haddon was at the head of the
gang and that Haddon, with Jillson and Dusenbury,
were in the habit of disposing of the animals
either at Omaha or Chicago, although one or
two steeds, including one belonging to the former
owners of Big Horn Ranch had been sent further
east.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it was one of the early thefts that
took Haddon to Haven Point,&#8221; declared Jack, and
in that surmise he was correct.</p>
<p>With this evidence against them, Haddon, Jillson
and Dusenbury were submitted to a severe
gruelling, each being examined separately. Finally
Dusenbury broke down completely and admitted
that he and the other two had fired John
Calder&#8217;s barn after stealing his noted pair of gray
horses. The horses had been shipped out of town,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
and were later on recovered, as were also Mr.
Powell&#8217;s Blackbird and several other of the animals.</p>
<p>When Bud Haddon&#8217;s effects were examined
many pawn tickets were discovered, and following
up the clues thus afforded Colonel Colby managed
to get back many of the articles stolen
from the school. These included Professor
Duke&#8217;s heirloom watch and a number of the things
lost by our friends.</p>
<p>At first it was thought that Brassy might be
prosecuted, but when Bud Haddon was brought
to trial for the thefts the State used the youth
as a witness against the fellow, and consequently
Brassy was allowed to go free. He, however, received
a stern lecture from Colonel Colby and was
then told that he had better not return to the
Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I want to come back,&#8221; said
Brassy. &#8220;A whole lot of the fellows would never
forgive me for what I did.&#8221; And in this surmise
he was probably correct. Brassy returned to his
uncle&#8217;s ranch, and that was the last heard of him
for a long time.</p>
<p>With the mystery of the robbery at Colby Hall
and of the missing horses cleared up, the Rover
boys and all the other young folks at Big Horn
Ranch turned their attention once more to having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
a good time. Sam Rover went back to New
York to take charge of the offices in Wall Street,
and that gave Dick Rover and his wife a chance
to come out and pay the ranch a visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve certainly had some strenuous times
here,&#8221; remarked Jack one day.</p>
<p>And he was right. But other strenuous times
were still in store for the lads, and what some of
these were will be related in the next volume, to
be entitled, &#8220;The Rover Boys at Big Bear Lake;
or, The Camps of the Rival Cadets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Big Horn Ranch is a delightful place,&#8221; said
Ruth. &#8220;I never thought a spot where they raised
cattle could be so interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your father going to stay out here and become
a regular ranchman, Spouter?&#8221; questioned
Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; answered the ranch
owner&#8217;s son. &#8220;He&#8217;ll stay here for a while, anyway.
He likes it better and better every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dink some day I got me a ranch mineself
alreatty,&#8221; remarked Hans Mueller. &#8220;Den I could
raise all mine own meats for mine delicatessen
stores, not so?&#8221; and he smiled complacently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, boys, let&#8217;s get on horseback and have
a race!&#8221; cried Andy, as he came up from finishing
a game of lawn tennis with Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you,&#8221; answered Fred, who had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
playing a game of croquet with May and some of
the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right! A horseback race it is!&#8221; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;An extra piece of cake to the boy who wins!&#8221;
shouted his sister Martha after him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Me for that piece of cake!&#8221; came
from every one of the boys assembled.</p>
<p>And here, while they are running down to the
corral pell-mell to get on their horses for a gallop
across the prairie, we will leave them and say
good-bye.</p>
